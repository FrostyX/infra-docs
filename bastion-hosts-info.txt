Purpose: background and description of bastion hosts and their unique issues. 

There are 2 bastion hosts in the phx2 datacenter. One will be active at any given 
time and the second will be a hot spare, ready to take over. Switching between 
bastion hosts is currently a manual process that requires changes in puppet. 

Both bastion hosts have an external IP that is mapped into them. 
The reverse dns for these IP's is controlled by RHIT, so any changes must be 
carefully coordinated. 

The active bastion host performs the following functions: 

* Outgoing smtp from fedora servers. This includes email aliases, mailing list posts, 
build and commit notices, mailing list posts, etc. 

* Incoming smtp from servers in phx2 or on the fedora vpn. Incoming mail directly 
from the outside is NOT accepted or forwarded. 

* ssh access to all phx2/vpn connected servers. 

* openvpn hub. This is the hub that all vpn clients connect to and talk to each other via. 
Taking down or stopping this service will be a major outage of services as all 
proxy and app servers use the vpn to talk to each other. 

NOTE: currently bastion01.fedoraproject.org is mapped to bastion03.phx2.fedoraproject.org
This is due to dns issues.
