Introduction

   Throughout this SOP, we will refer to the old hostname as $oldhostname and
   the new hostname as $newhostname. We will refer to the Dom0 host that the
   vm resides on as $vmhost.

   If this process is being followed so that a temporary-named host can
   replace a production host, please be sure to follow the [51]Infrastructure
   retire machine SOP to properly decommission the old host before
   continuing.

Finding out where the host is

   In order to rename the host, you must have access to the Dom0 (host) on
   which the virtual server resides. To find out which host that is, log in
   to puppet01, and run:

 grep $oldhostname /var/log/virthost-lists.out

   The first column of the output will be the Dom0 of the virtual node.

Preparation

   SSH to $oldhostname. If the new name is replacing a production box, change
   the IP Address that it binds to, in
   `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`.

   Also change the hostname in `/etc/sysconfig/network`.

   We can also remove old puppet SSL certs, because they will need to be
   re-generated. On $oldhostname:

 find /var/lib/puppet/ssl -type f -print | xargs rm -v

   At this point, you can `sudo poweroff` $oldhostname.

   Open an ssh session to $vmhost, and make sure that the node is listed as
   `shut off`. If it is not, you can force it off with:

 virsh destroy $oldhostname

Renaming the Logical Volume

   Find out the name of the logical volume (on $vmhost):

 virsh dumpxml $oldhostname | grep 'source dev'

   This will give you a line that looks like `<source
   dev='/dev/VolGroup00/$oldhostname'/>` which tells you that
   `/dev/VolGroup00/$oldhostname` is the path to the logical volume.

   Run `/usr/sbin/lvrename (the path that you found above) (the path that you
   found above, with $newhostname at the end instead of $oldhostname)`

   For example, `/usr/sbin/lvrename /dev/VolGroup00/noc03-tmp
   /dev/VolGroup00/noc01`.

Doing the actual rename

   Now that the logical volume has been renamed, we can rename the host in
   libvirt.

   Dump the configuration of $oldhostname into an xml file, by running:

 virsh dumpxml $oldhostname > $newhostname.xml

   Open up $newhostname.xml, and change all instances of $oldhostname to
   $newhostname.

   Save the file and run:

 virsh define $newhostname.xml

   If there are no errors above, you can undefine $oldhostname:

 virsh undefine $oldhostname

   Power on $newhostname, with:

 virsh start $newhostname

   And remember to set it to autostart:

 virsh autostart $newhostname

Telling Puppet about the new host

   We cleared out the old puppet certifications on $oldhostname before we
   shut it down, but we need generate new certifications on it, and tell
   puppetmaster about them.

   First off, rename any node files in puppet/manifests/nodes/$oldhostname*,
   and change the `node $oldhostname {` to `node $newhostname {` in this
   file.

   Then, on puppet01:

 /usr/sbin/puppetca --revoke --clean $oldhostname

   On $newhostname:

 /usr/sbin/puppetd -t

   On puppet01:

 /usr/sbin/puppetca --list # to get the full hostname
 /usr/sbin/puppetca --sign # the hostname found on the previous command.

   Re-run puppet on $newhostname, and fix errors as they arise.

 /usr/sbin/puppetd -t
