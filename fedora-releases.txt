Fedora Release Infrastructure SOP

   This SOP contains all of the steps required by the Fedora Infrastructure
   team in order to get a release out. Much of this work overlaps with the
   Release Engineering team (and at present share many of the same members).
   Some work may get done by releng, some may get done by Infrastructure, as
   long as it gets done, it doesn't matter.

Description

Preparations

   Before Alpha for a release ships, the following items need to be
   completed. *Please open a ticket for all of them individually*
   Tickets should be opened at freeze time. 

    1. New website from the websites team (typically hosted at
       http://fedoraproject.org/_/), edit syncStatic.sh to freeze the
       website in preparation for release updates.
    2. Verify mirror space (for all test releases as well)
    3. Release day ticket and milestone (keep a log of who is doing what and notes)
    4. Verify with rel-eng permissions on content are right on the mirrors.  Don't leak.
    5. Communication with Red Hat IS (Give at least 2 months notice, then
       reminders as the time comes near) (final release only)
    6. Infrastructure change freeze
    7. Modify Template:FedoraVersion to reference new version. (Final release only)
    8. Re-review Lessons Learned pages from previous release, be sure we
       aren't forgetting things we meant to do after the last release.
    9. Add the new release to stats gathering scripts on log1
       (modules/scripts/files/fedoraUsage.sh, also the maps should be
       updated) (Final release only)
   10. Move old releases to archive (final release only)

  Change Freeze

   The rules are simple. If we are in a pre release freeze or a full freeze,
   take a look at the architecture document. If the hostname is in the
   freeze area, that entire host is frozen. So making global changes is also
   forbidden. If, for some reason, a change needs to be made, a request must
   go to the fedora-infrastructure-list requesting it. It will require at
   least two people to signoff on the change from either sysadmin-main or the
   releng group. Exceptions to this include:

     * Planned changes as part of the release
     * Emergencies / outages

   Change freezes will be sent to the fedora-infrastructure-list and begin 2
   weeks before each release and the final release. The freeze will end one
   day after the release. Note, if the release slips during a change freeze,
   the freeze just extends until the day after a release ships.

   You can get a list of frozen/non-frozen hosts by: 

   git clone http://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/infra/ansible.git
   scripts/freezelist -i inventory/inventory

   Each one of these tasks except for the release day ticket must be
   completed and closed prior to the release.

Notes about release day

   Release day is always an interesting and unique event. After the final
   sprint from test to the final release a lot of the developers will be
   looking forward to a bit of time away, as well as some sleep. Once Release
   Engineering has built the final tree, and synced it to the mirrors it is
   our job to make sure everything else (except the bit flip) gets done as
   painlessly and easily as possible.

   All communication is typically done in #fedora-admin. Typically these
   channels are laid back and staying on topic isn't strictly enforced. On
   release day this is not true. We encourage people to come, stay in the
   room and be quiet unless they have a specific task or question releated to
   release day. Its nothing personal, but release day can get out of hand
   quick.

   During normal load, our websites function as normal. This is especially
   true since we've moved the wiki to mod_fcgi. On release day our load
   spikes a great deal. During the Fedora 6 launch many services were offline
   for hours. Some (like the docs) were off for days. A large part of this
   outage was due to the wiki not being able to handle the load, part was a
   lack of planning by the Infrastructure team, and part is still a mystery.
   (There are questions as to whether or not all of the traffic was legit or
   a ddos.

   The Fedora 7 release went much better. Some services were offline for
   minutes at a time but very little of it was out longer then that. The wiki
   crashed, as it always does. We had made sure to make the fedoraproject.org
   landing page static though. This helped a great deal though we did see
   load on the proxy boxes as spiky.

Day Prior to Release Day

  Step 1 (Torrent)

   Setup the torrent. All files can be synced with the torrent box
   but just not published to the world. Verify with sha1sum. Follow the
   instructions on the torrentrelease.txt sop up to and including step 4.

  Step 2 (Website)

   Verify the website design / content has been finalized with the websites
   team. Update the Fedora version number wiki template if this is a final
   release. It will need to be changed in: 

https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Template:CurrentFedoraVersion

   Additionally, there are redirects in the puppet proxy.pp file for cloud
   Images. These should be pushed as soon as the content is available. 
   See: https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/ticket/3866 for example

  Step 3 (Mirrors)

   Verify enough mirrors are setup and have Fedora ready for release. If for
   some reason something is broken it needs to be fixed. Many of the mirrors
   are running a check-in script. This lets us know who has Fedora without
   having to scan everyone. Hide the Alpha, Beta, and Preview releases from
   the publiclist page.

   You can check this by looking at: 
	
	wget
"http://mirrors.fedoraproject.org/mirrorlist?path=pub/fedora/linux/releases/test/20-Alpha&country=global"

	(replace 20 and Alpha with the version and release.)

  Step 4 (Enable Updates)

   The new Fedora release will likely have 0day updates. Making sure we can
   push those updates is important.

   Move MirrorManager repository tags from the development/$version/
   Directory objects, to the releases/$version/ Directory objects. This is
   done using the move-devel-to-release --version=$version command on bapp02.
   This is usually done now a week or two after release. 

   As far as bodhi is concerned

     * Create the new release in bodhi, to allow developers to queue up 0day
       updates. Make sure this is 'locked' so they don't get pushed. See the
       bodhi administration page for instructions.
     * Create mash config files for the new release
     * If the mash config files have already been created, make sure the
       delta_dirs are updated to reflect the GA file locations (You should
       just uncomment the line that says "Enable this once F$version
       releases" and delete the other delta_dirs line)
     * Make sure the dist-fX-updates{,-testing} tags are creating in Koji
     * Make sure the rsync script is updated
     * When it's time to push, simply unlock the release in bodhi and you
       should be good to go.

  Step 5 (Lessons Learned page)

   Set up a new page like  to record findings we'll use next release cycle.

Release day

  Step 1 (Prep and wait)

   Verify the mirrors are ready and that the torrent has valid copies of its
   files (use sha1sum)

   Do not move on to step two until the Release Engineering team has given
   the ok for the release. It is the releng team's decision as to whether or
   not we release and they may pull the plug at any moment.

  Step 2 (Torrent)

   Once given the ok to release, the Infrastructure team should publish the
   torrent and encourage people to seed. Complete the steps on the
   http://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/infra/docs/torrentrelease.txt
   after step 4. 

  Step 3 (Bit flip)

   The mirrors sit and wait for a single permissions bit to be altered so
   that they show up to their services. The bit flip (done by the releng
   team) will replicate out to the mirrors. Verify that the mirrors have
   received the change by seeing if it is actually available, just use a spot
   check. Once that is complete move on.

  Step 4 (AutoQA repoinfo.conf)

   The AutoQA project maintains a config file (repoinfo.conf) that
   describes available package repositories and their inheritance. To support
   automated testing of Fedora packages, the repoinfo.conf file needs to be
   updated. Please file an autoqa ticket to modify the repoinfo.conf file
   to include pointers to the new release.

  Step 5 (Fedora-Packages yum-repo.conf)

   The Fedora Packages webapp needs to have its yum config updated to consume
   the latest release.  Add a new block of entries to
   puppet/modules/fedoracommunity/files/yum-repo.conf

  Step 6 (Website)

   Once all of the distribution pieces are verified (mirrors and torrent),
   all that is left is to publish the website. At present this is done by
   making sure the master branch of fedora-web is pulled by the syncStatic.sh
   script in puppet (which contains instructions for switching this). It will
   sync in an hour normally but on release day people don't like to wait that
   long so do the following on bapp01:

   sudo -u apache /usr/local/bin/lock-wrapper syncStatic 'sh -x /usr/local/bin/syncStatic'
   
   Once that completes, on lockbox01: 

   sudo -i ansible proxy\* "/usr/bin/rsync --delete -a --no-owner --no-group bapp02::fedoraproject.org/ /srv/web/fedoraproject.org/"

   Verify http://fedoraproject.org/ is working.

   Also, ensure that /get-prerelease now redirects to /get-fedora. The
   appropriate configuration is available in the puppet configs in
   modules/fedora-web/files/redirects.conf.

  Step 7 (Docs)

   Just as with the website, the docs site needs to be published. Just as
   above follow the following steps:

 /root/bin/docs-sync

  Step 8 (Monitor)

   Once the website is live, keep an eye on various news sites for the
   release announcement. Closely watch the load on all of the boxes, proxy,
   application and otherwise. If something is getting overloaded, see
   suggestions on this page in the "Juggling Resources" section.

  Step 9 (Badges)

   We have some badge rules that are dependent on which release of Fedora
   we're on.  As you have time, please performs the following on your local
   box:

    $ git clone ssh://git.fedorahosted.org/git/badges.git
    $ cd badges

   Edit rules/tester-it-still-works.yml and update the release tag to match
   the now old but stable release.  For instance, if we just released fc21,
   then the tag in that badge rule should be fc20.

    $ git commit -a -m 'Updated tester badge rule for f21 release.'
    $ git push origin master

   Then, on lockbox, perform the following

    $ git clone https://git.fedorahosted.org/git/badges.git
    $ cd badges
    $ git remote add lockbox /git/badges
    $ git push lockbox master

   We keep these two different repos so 1) external people can contribute to
   the fedorahosted one but 2) only sysadmins can actually push to the repo
   on lockbox used by our ansible playbooks.

   Once you've pushed to the /git/badges repo on lockbox, run the
   badges-backend playbook with:

    $ sudo -i ansible-playbook /srv/web/infra/ansible/playbooks/groups/badges-backend.yml

  Step 10 (Done)

   Just chill, keep an eye on everything and make changes as needed. If you
   can't keep a service up, try to redirect randomly to some of the mirrors.

  Priorities

   Priorities of during release day (In order):

    1. Website - Anything related to a user landing at fedoraproject.org, and
       clicking through to a mirror or torrent to download something must be
       kept up. This is distribution, and without it we can potentially lose
       many users.
    2. Linked addresses - We do not have direct control over what Digg,
       Slashdot or anyone else links to. If they link to something on the
       wiki and it is going down or link to any other site we control a
       rewrite should be put in place to direct them to
       http://fedoraproject.org/get-fedora.
    3. Torrent - The torrent server has never had problems during a release.
       Make sure it is up.
    4. Release Notes - Typically grouped with the docs site, the release
       notes are often linked to (this is fine, no need to redirect) but keep
       an eye on the logs and ensure that where we've said the release notes
       are, that they can be found there. In previous releases we sometimes
       had to make this available in more than one spot.
    5. docs.fedoraproject.org - People will want to see whats new in Fedora
       and get further documentation about it. Much of this is in the release
       notes.
    6. wiki - Because it is so resource heavy, and because it is so developer
       oriented we have no choice but to give the wiki a lower priority.
    7. Everything else.

Juggling Resources

   In our environment we're running different things on many different
   servers. Using Xen we can easily give machines more or less ram,
   processors. We can take down builders and bring up application servers.
   The trick is to be smart and make sure you understand what is causing the
   problem. These are some tips to keep in mind:

     * IPTables based bandwidth and connection limiting (successful in the
       past)
     * Altering the weight on the proxy balancers (see: [96]Balancers )
     * Create static pages out of otherwise dynamic content
     * Redirect pages to a mirror
     * Add a server / remove un-needed servers
