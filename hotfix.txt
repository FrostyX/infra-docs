HOTFIXES SOP 

From time to time we have to quickly patch a problem or issue 
in applications in our infrastructure. 

When we apply these to puppet using hosts,
they are in the modules/hotfix area of puppet. 

For ansible, they should be placed after the task that installs
the package to be changed or modified. Either in roles or tasks. 

hotfix tasks should be called "HOTFIX: description" 
They should also link in comments to any upstream bug or ticket.

The process is: 

- Create a diff of any files changed in the fix. 
- Check in the _original_ files and hotfix manifest (puppet)
- Check in the _original_ files and change to role/task
- Check in now your diffs of those same files. 
- puppet or ansible will replace the files on the affected machines 
completely with the fixed versions. 
- If you need to back it out, you can revert the diff step, 
wait and then remove the first checkin

Also, if at all possible a bug should be filed with the upstream
application to get the fix in the next version.
