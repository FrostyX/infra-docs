HOTFIXES SOP 

From time to time we have to quickly patch a problem or issue 
in applications in our infrastructure. 

When we apply these, they are in the modules/hotfix area of puppet. 

The process is: 

- Create a diff of any files changed in the fix. 
- Check in the _original_ files and hotfix manifest
- Check in now your diffs of those same files. 
- puppet will replace the files on the affected machines 
completely with the fixed versions. 
- If you need to back it out, you can revert the diff step, 
wait and then remove the first checkin

When you make a hotfix you should file a ticket with the issue
or problem and note the hotfix. It should be marked keywords
'hotfix' and have HOTFIX in the title. 

Also, if at all possible a bug should be filed with the upstream
application to get the fix in the next version.
