fedmsg-gateway SOP
==================

  Outgoing raw ZeroMQ message stream.

Contact Information
-------------------

  Owner:        Messaging SIG, Fedora Infrastructure Team
  Contact:      #fedora-apps, #fedora-admin, #fedora-noc
  Servers:      busgateway01, proxy0*
  Purpose:      Expose raw ZeroMQ messages outside the FI environment.

Description
-----------

  Users outside of Fedora Infrastructure can listen to the production message
  bus by connecting specific addresses.  This is required for local users to
  run their own hubs and message processors ("Consumers").  It is also
  required for user-facing tools like fedmsg-notify to work.
  
  The specific public endpoints are:

    - production    - tcp://hub.fedoraproject.org:9940
    - staging       - tcp://stg.fedoraproject.org:9940

  fedmsg-gateway, the daemon running on busgateway01, is listening to the FI
  production fedmsg bus and will relay every message that it receives out to a
  special ZMQ pub endpoint bound to port 9940.  haproxy mediates connections
  to the fedmsg-gateway daemon.

Connection Flow
---------------

  Clients connect through haproxy on proxy0*:9940 are redirected to
  busgateway0*:9940.  This can be found in the haproxy.cfg entry for
  "listen fedmsg-raw-zmq 0.0.0.0:9940".

  This is different than the apache reverse proxy pass setup we have for the
  app0* and packages0* machines.  *That* flow looks something like this:

    Client -> apache(proxy01) -> haproxy(proxy01) -> apache(app01)

  The flow for the raw zmq stream provided by fedmsg-gateway looks something
  like this:

    Client -> haproxy(proxy01) -> fedmsg-gateway(proxy01)

  haproxy is listening on a public port.

  At the time of this writing, haproxy does not actually load balance zeromq
  session requests across multiple busgateway0* machines, but there is nothing
  stopping us from adding them.  New hosts can be added in puppet and pressed
  from busgateway01's template.  Add them to the fedmsg-raw-zmq listen in
  haproxy's config and it should Just Work.

Increasing the Maximum Number of Concurrent Connections
-------------------------------------------------------

  HTTP requests are typically very short (a few seconds at most).  This
  means that the number of concurrent tcp connections we require for most
  of our services is quite low (1024 is overkill).  ZeroMQ tcp connections,
  on the other hand, are expected to live for quite a long time.
  Consequently we needed to scale up the number of possible concurrent tcp
  connections.
  
  All of this is in puppet and should be handled for us automatically if we
  bring up new nodes.
  
    - The pam_limits user limit for the fedmsg user was increased from
      1024 to 160000 on busgateway01.
    - The pam_limits user limit for the haproxy user was increased from
      1024 to 160000 on the proxy0* machines.
    - The zeromq High Water Mark (HWM) was increased to 160000 on
      busgateway01.
    - The maximum number of connections allowed was increased in haproxy.cfg.

Nagios
------

  New nagios checks were added for this that check to see if the number of
  concurrent connections through haproxy is approaching the maximum number
  allowed.

  You can check these numbers by hand by inspecting the haproxy web interface:

    https://admin.fedoraproject.org/haproxy/proxy1#fedmsg-raw-zmq

  Look at the "Sessions" section.  "Cur" is the current number of sessions
  versus "Max", the maximum number seen at the same time and "Limit", the
  maximum number of concurrent connections allowed.

RHIT
----

  We had RHIT open up port 9940 special to proxy01.phx2 for this.
