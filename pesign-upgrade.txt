Pesign upgrades/reboots
-----------------------
Fedora has (currently) 2 special builders. These builders are used to 
build a small set of packages that need to be signed for secure boot. 
These packages include: grub2, shim, kernel, pesign-test-app

When rebooting or upgrading pesign on these machines, you have to 
follow a special process to unlock the signing keys. 

Contact Information
-------------------

  Owner:        Fedora Release Engineering, Kernel/grub2/shim/pesign maintainers
  Contact:      #fedora-admin, #fedora-kernel
  Servers:      bkernel01, bkernel02
  Purpose:      Upgrade or restart singning keys on kernel/grub2/shim builders

Description
-----------
0. Coordinate with pesign maintainers or pesign-test-app commiters as well
as releng folks that have the pin to unlock the signing key. 

1. remove builder from koji: 

koji disable-host bkernel01.phx2.fedoraproject.org

2. Make sure all builds have completed. 

3. Stop existing processes: 

service pcscd stop
service pesign stop

4. Perform updates or reboots. 

5. Restart services (if you didn't reboot): 

service pcscd start
service pesign start

6. Unlock signing key: 

pesign-client -t "OpenSC Card (Fedora Signer)" -u
(enter pin when prompted)

7. Make sure no builds are in progress, then Re-add builder to koji, remove other builder: 


koji enable-host bkernel01.phx2.fedoraproject.org
koji disable-host bkernel02.phx2.fedoraproject.org

8. Have a commiter send a build of pesign-test-app and make sure it's signed correctly. 

9. If so, repeat process with second builder.
