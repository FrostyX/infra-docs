websocket SOP
=============

  websocket communication with Fedora apps.

  .. see-also:  `fedmsg-gateway.txt`_

Contact Information
-------------------

  Owner:        Messaging SIG, Fedora Infrastructure Team
  Contact:      #fedora-apps, #fedora-admin, #fedora-noc
  Servers:      busgateway01, proxy0*, app0*
  Purpose:      Expose a websocket server for FI apps to use

Description
-----------

  WebSocket is a protocol (an extension of HTTP/1.1) by which client web
  browsers can establish full-duplex socket communications with a server --
  the "real-time web".

  In our case, webapps served from app0* and packages0* will include
  javascript code instructing client browsers to establish a second connection
  to our WebSocket server.  They point browsers to the following addresses:

    - production    - wss://hub.fedoraproject.org:9939
    - staging       - wss://stg.fedoraproject.org:9939

  The websocket server itself is a fedmsg-hub daemon running on busgateway01.
  It is configured to enable its websocket server component in the presence of
  certain configuration values.

  haproxy mediates connections to the fedmsg-hub websocket server daemon.
  An stunnel daemon provides SSL support.

Connection Flow
---------------

  The connection flow is much the same as in the fedmsg-gateway.txt SOP, but
  is somewhat more complicated.

  "Normal" HTTP requests to our app servers traverse the following chain:

    Client -> apache(proxy01) -> haproxy(proxy01) -> apache(app01)

  The flow for a websocket requests looks something like this:

    Client -> stunnel(proxy01) -> haproxy(proxy01) -> fedmsg-hub(busgateway01)

  stunnel is listening on a public port, negotiates the SSL connection, and
  redirects the connection to haproxy who in turn hands it off to
  the fedmsg-hub websocket server listening on busgateway01.

  At the time of this writing, haproxy does not actually load balance zeromq
  session requests across multiple busgateway0* machines, but there is nothing
  stopping us from adding them.  New hosts can be added in puppet and pressed
  from busgateway01's template.  Add them to the fedmsg-websockets listen in
  haproxy's config and it should Just Work.

RHIT
----

  We had RHIT open up port 9939 special to proxy01.phx2 for this.
