Replacing Key


 We have written a script to grab all the pubkeys from the captured items in
puppet. check out puppet:

   git clone /git/puppet
   cd puppet/modules/ssh/files
   sudo python fetch-ssh-keys.py > ssh_known_hosts
   git commit -a
   git push

That should do it.

Just like magic, or something.
