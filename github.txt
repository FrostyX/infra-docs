===============================
Using github for Infra Projects
===============================

We're presently using github to host git repositories and issue tracking for
some infrastructure projects.  Anything we need to know should be recorded
here.

---------------------
Setting up a new repo
---------------------

Create projects inside of the fedora-infra group:

https://github.com/fedora-infra

That will allow us to more easily track what projects we have.

[TODO] How do we create a new project and import it?


Add an EasyFix tag
==================

The EasyFix tag is used to mark bugs that are potentially fixable by new
contributors getting used to our source code or relatively new to python
programming.

curl -k -u '$GITHUB_USERNAME:$GITHUB_PASSWORD' https://api.github.com/repos/fedora-infra/python-fedora/labels -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"EasyFix","color":"3b6eb4"}'

[TODO] how do we then add this to http://fedoraproject.org/easyfix ?
