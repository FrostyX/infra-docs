===============================
Using github for Infra Projects
===============================

We're presently using github to host git repositories and issue tracking for
some infrastructure projects.  Anything we need to know should be recorded
here.

---------------------
Setting up a new repo
---------------------

Create projects inside of the fedora-infra group:

https://github.com/fedora-infra

That will allow us to more easily track what projects we have.

[TODO] How do we create a new project and import it?


Add an EasyFix label
====================

The EasyFix label is used to mark bugs that are potentially fixable by new
contributors getting used to our source code or relatively new to python
programming.  GitHub doesn't provide this label automatically so we have to
add it.  AFAIK, adding labels is only available via the web API so use the
following curl command to add it:

curl -k -u '$GITHUB_USERNAME:$GITHUB_PASSWORD' https://api.github.com/repos/fedora-infra/python-fedora/labels -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"EasyFix","color":"3b6eb4"}'

You can then add the github repo to the list that easyfix.fedoraproject.org
scans for easyfix tickets here:
