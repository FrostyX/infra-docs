Fedora Cloud
============

= Quick start =

Controler:
sudo  rbac-playbook hosts/fed-cloud09.cloud.fedoraproject.org.yml

Compute nodes:
sudo  rbac-playbook groups/openstack-compute-nodes.yml

= Description =

If you need to install OpenStack install, either make sure the machine is clean.
Or use ansible.git/files/fedora-cloud/uninstall.sh script to brute force wipe off.
Note that by default, it does not wipe LVM group with VM, you have to clean
them manually (there is commented line in that script)
Then remove on fed-clou09 the file
  /etc/packstack_sucessfully_finished
to enforce run of packstack and few other commands.

After that wipe, you have to:
 * ifdown eth1
 * configure eth1 to become normal Ethernet with ip
 * yum install openstack-neutron-openvswitch
 * /usr/bin/systemctl restart neutron-ovs-cleanup
 * ifup eth1

Additionally when reprovision OpenStack, all volumes on DellEqualogic are
preserved and you have to manually remove them (or remove them from OS before
it is reprovision). SSH to DellEqualogic (credentials are at the bottom of
/etc/cinder/cinder.conf) and run:
 * show  (to get list of volumes)
 * volume select <volume_name> offline
 * volume delete <volume_name>

Before installing make sure:
 * make sure rdo repo is enabled
 * yum install openstack-packstack openstack-packstack-puppet openstack-puppet-modules-
   vim /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/packstack/plugins/dashboard_500.py
   and missing parentheses:
     host_resources.append((ssl_key, 'ssl_ps_server.key'))

Now you can run playbook:
 sudo rbac-playbook hosts/fed-cloud09.cloud.fedoraproject.org.yml

If you run it after wipe (i.e. db has been reset), you have to:
 * import ssh keys of users (only possible via webUI - RHBZ 1128233
 * reset user passwords


= Compute nodes =

Compute node is much easier and is written as role. Use:

  vars_files:
   - ... SNIP
   - /srv/web/infra/ansible/vars/fedora-cloud.yml
   - "{{ private }}/files/openstack/passwords.yml"

  roles:
  ... SNIP 
  - cloud_compute

And define:
  compute_private_ip: 172.23.0.10
as host variable in inventory/host_vars/FQDN.yml 

You should also add IP to 
  vars/fedora-cloud.yml

And when adding new compute node, please update:
  files/fedora-cloud/hosts

= Important =

When reinstalling make sure you removed all members on Dell Equalogic
(credentials are in /etc/cinder/cinder.conf on compute node) otherwise the
space will be blocked!!!

= Troubleshooting =
 * could not connect to VM? - check your security group, default SG does not
   allow any connection.
 * packstack end up with error, it is likely race condition in puppet - BZ 1135529. Just run it again.
 * ERROR : append() takes exactly one argument (2 given
   vi /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/packstack/plugins/dashboard_500.py
   and add one more surrounding () 
 * Local ip for ovs agent must be set when tunneling is enabled 
   restart fed-cloud09 or:
   ssh to fed-cloud09; ifdown eth1; ifup eth1; ifup br-ex
 * mongodb problem? follow
