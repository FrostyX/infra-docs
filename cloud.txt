Fedora Cloud
============

If you need to install OpenStack install, either make sure the machine is clean.
Or use ansible.git/files/fedora-cloud/uninstall.sh script to brute force wipe off.

After that wipe, you have to:
 * ifdown eth1
 * configure eth1 to become normal Ethernet with ip
 * yum install openstack-neutron-openvswitch
 * /usr/bin/systemctl restart neutron-ovs-cleanup
 * ifup eth1

Before installing make sure:
 * make sure rdo repo is enabled
 * yum install openstack-packstack openstack-packstack-puppet openstack-puppet-modules-
   vim /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/packstack/plugins/dashboard_500.py
   and missing parentheses:
     host_resources.append((ssl_key, 'ssl_ps_server.key'))

Now you can run playbook:
 sudo rbac-playbook hosts/fed-cloud09.cloud.fedoraproject.org.yml

If you run it after wipe (i.e. db has been reset), you have to:
 * import ssh keys of users (only possible via webUI - RHBZ 1128233
 * reset user passwords
