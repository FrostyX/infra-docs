Creating a new election

  Creating the elections

   Go to "Admin" in the menu at the top, select "Create new election" and fill
   in the form.

   The "usefas" option results in candidate names being looked up as FAS
   usernames an displayed as their real name.

   An alias should be added when creating a new election as this is used in
   the link on the page of listed elections on the frontpage.

                     to release the results of the election
   Legal voters groups  Used to restrict the votes to one or more FAS groups
   Admin groups      Give admin rights on that election to one or more FAS
                     groups


  Adding Candidates

   The list of all the elections can be found at voting/admin/

   Click on the election of interest and and select "Add a candidate".

   Each candidate is added with a name and an URL. The name can be his/her FAS
   username (interesting if the checkbox that candidates are FAS users has been
   checked when creating the calendar) or something else.
   The URL can be a reference to the wiki page where they nominated themselves.

   This will add extra candidates to the available list.

  Who can vote

   If no 'Legal voters groups' have been defined when creating the election, the
   election will be opened to anyone having signed the CLA and being in one
   other group (commonly referred to CLA+1).

Modifying an Election

  Changing the details of an Election

   * Note -- this page can also be used to verify details of an election
     before it opens for voting.

   The list of all the elections can be found at /voting/admin/

   After finding the right election, click on it to have the overview and select
   "Edit election" under the description.

  Edit a candidate

  On the election overview page found via /voting/admin/ (and clicking on the
  election of interest), next to each candidate is an `[edit]` button allowing
  the admins to edit the information relative to the candidate.

  Removing a candidate

   
  On the election overview page found via /voting/admin/ (and clicking on the
  election of interest), next to each candidate is an `[x]` button allowing
  the admins to remove the candidatei from the election.


Releasing the results of an embargoed election

   Visit the elections admin interface and edit the election to uncheck the
   'Embargo results?' checkbox.

Results

  Admins have early access to the results of the elections (regardless of the
  embargo status).

  The list of the closed elections can be found at /voting/archives.

  Find there the election of interest and click on the "Results" link in the
  last column of the table.
  This will show you the Results page included who was elected based on the
  number of seats elected entered when creating the election.

  You may use these information to send out the results email.



== Legacy

The information below should now be included in the Results page (see above) but
I left them here in case.
                                ----------

Other things you might need to query

  The current election software doesn't retrieve all of the information that
  we like to include in our results emails.  So we have to query the database
  for the extra information.  You can use something like this to retrieve the
  total number of voters for the election:

  SELECT e.id, e.shortdesc, COUNT(distinct v.voter) FROM elections AS e LEFT
JOIN votes AS v ON e.id=v.election_id WHERE e.shortdesc in ('FAmSCo - February
2014') GROUP BY e.id, e.shortdesc;


  You may also want to include the vote tally per candidate for convenience
  when the FPL emails the election results:

  SELECT e.id, e.shortdesc, c.name, c.novotes FROM elections AS e LEFT JOIN
fvotecount AS c ON e.id=c.election_id WHERE e.shortdesc in ('FAmSCo - February
2014', 'FESCo - February 2014') ;
