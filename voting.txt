   An alias should be added when creating a new election as this is used in
   the link on the page of listed elections on the frontpage.

  Adding Candidates

   A list of all elections (and their IDs) can be found at
   voting/admin/list_elections

   Go to voting/admin/newc and fill in the form, using the id found through
   list_elections.

   This will add extra candidates to the available list.

  Who can vote

   Before anyone can vote you need to manually alter the database to say
   which groups are permitted to vote in the election.

   There are 2 magic GROUPNAME strings that can be used

     * anycla - (any FAS group not beginning cla_)
     * anyany - (any FAS group)

   Put one of the above group names or a specific FAS group into the 'Allowed
   Groups' field.
