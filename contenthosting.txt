Description

   Fedora hosts both Fedora content and some non-Fedora content. Our
   resources are finite and as such we have to have some policy around when
   to remove old content. This SOP describes the test to remove content. The
   spirit of this SOP is to allow more people to host content and give it a
   try, prove that it's useful. If it's not popular or useful, it will get
   removed. Also out of date or expired content will be removed.

What hosting options are available

   Aside from the hosting at http://fedorahosted.org/ we have a series of
   mirrors we're allowing people to use. They are located at:

     * http://archive.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/ - For archives of
       historical Fedora releases
     * http://secondary.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora-secondary/ - For
       secondary architectures
     * http://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/ - For misc content /
       catchall
     * http://torrent.fedoraproject.org/ - For torrent hosting
     * http://spins.fedoraproject.org/ - For official Fedora Spins
       hosting, mirrored somewhat
     * http://download.fedoraproject.com/pub/ - For official Fedora
       Releases, mirrored widely

Who can host? What can be hosted?

   Any official Fedora content can hosted and made available for mirroring.
   Official content is determined by the Board by virtue of allowing people
   to use the Fedora trademark. People representing these teams will be
   allowed to host.

  Non Official Hosting

   People wanting to host unofficial bits may request approval for hosting.
   Create a ticket at https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/
   explaining what and why Fedora should host it. Such will be reviewed by
   the Fedora Infrastructure team.

   Requests for non-official hosting that may conflict with existing Fedora
   policies will be escalated to the Board for approval.

  Licensing

   Anything hosted with Fedora must come with a Free software license that is
   approved by Fedora. See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Licensing for
   more.

  Requesting Space

     * Make sure you have a Fedora account -
       https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/
     * Ensure you have signed the Fedora Project Contributor Agreement (FPCA)
     * Submit a hosting request -
       https://fedorahosted.org/fedora-infrastructure/

          * Include who you are, and any group you are working with (e.g. a SIG)
          * Include Space requirements
          * Include an estimate of the number of downloads expected (if you can).
          * Include the nature of the bits you want to host.

     * Apply for group hosted-content -
       https://admin.fedoraproject.org/accounts/group/view/hosted-content

  Using Space

   A dedicated namespace in the mirror will be assigned to you. It will be
   your responsibility to upload content, remove old content, stay within
   your quota, etc. If you have any questions or concerns about this please
   let us know. Generally you will use rsync. For example:

 rsync -av --progress ./my.iso secondary01.fedoraproject.org:/srv/pub/alt/mySpace/

  Important Notice About Backups

   None of our mirrored content is backed up. Ensure that you keep backups of
   your content.

Content Pruning / Purging / Removal

   The following guidelines / tests will be used to determine whether or not
   to remove content from the mirror.

  Expired / Old Content

   If content meets any of the following criteria it may be removed:

     * Content that has reached the end of life (is no longer receiving
       updates).
     * Pre-release content that has been superceded.
     * EOL releases that have been moved to archives.
     * N-2 or greater releases. If more than 3 versions of a piece of content
       are on the mirror, the oldest may be removed.

  Limited Use Content

   If content meets any of the following criteria it may be removed:

     * Content with exceedingly limited seeders or downloaders, with little
       prospect of increasing those numbers and which is older then 1 year.
     * Content such as videos or audio which are several years old.

  Catch All Removal

   Fedora reserves the right to remove any content for any reason at any
   time. We'll do our best to host things but sometimes we'll need space or
   just need to remove stuff for legal or policy reasons.
