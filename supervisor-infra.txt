Supervisor Infrastructure SOP

   Important
   This SOP is slowly going by the wayside. Almost all new apps are being
   deployed using mod_wsgi. See - [46]TurboGears Infrastructure SOP

   Supervisor is a service that supplements the normalÂ !SystemVinit on a
   machine. It is configured via a config file /etc/supervisord.conf which is
   managed by puppet. The config file contains an entry for each service that
   it is in charge of starting. Supervisor handles starting the services at
   bootup and also respawning in case of errors. People can connect to the
   supervisor process via the supervisorctl command to manage services even
   if they don't have root on the box.

   We use supervisor to control all of our TurboGears apps. (Almost all of
   our in-house web applications)
