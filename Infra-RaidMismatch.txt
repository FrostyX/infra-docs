Description

   In some situations a raid device may indicate there is a count mismatch as
   listed in:

 /sys/block/mdX/md/mismatch_cnt

   Anything other than 0 is considered not good. Though if the number is low
   it's probably nothing to worry about. To correct this situation try the
   directions below

Correction

   More than anything these steps are to A) Verify there is no problem and B)
   make the error go away. If step 1 and step 2 don't correct the problems,
   PROCEED WITH CAUTION. The steps below, however, should be relatively safe.

  Step 1

   Issue a repair (replace mdX with the questionable raid device):

 echo repair > /sys/block/mdX/md/sync_action

   Depending on the size of the array and disk speed this can take a while.
   Watch the progress with:

 cat /proc/mdstat

   Once that's done proceed to Step 2.

  Step 2

   Issue a check. It's this check that will reset the mismatch count if there
   are no problems. Again replace mdX with your actual raid device.

 echo check > /sys/block/mdX/md/sync_action

   Just as before, you can watch the progress with:

 cat /proc/mdstat
