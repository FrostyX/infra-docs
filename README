infrastructure documents

This repository is for the infrastructure documentation and SOPs(Standard
Operating Procedures). These explain what we do, when we do it and, often,
why we do it.

== Cloning this repo ==

 If you plan to push changes (write) to this repo:

 If you simply want to read or don't have access to push:

 git clone https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/infra/infra-docs.git/

git grep is your friend in this dir.
Files should be in text.
they will be outputted to:

Information to include:

.. title: <Title of document>
.. slug: <the filename>
.. date: <Date created in YYYY-MM-DD>

Migration from the Wiki:
==============

For each SOP:

1. Copy the content out of the wiki version into a text file.
  a good way to do this is to run:

  links -dump $url > filename.txt

2. Update or clean up any wording that should be cleaned up or changed.

3. Commit to new repo and push.

4. Change the wiki page to note that the SOP has been converted and redirect
to a    wiki page that explains about the git repo and how to access it and/or a
link to that  particular sop.
