infrastructure documents

This repository is for the infrastructure documentation and SOPs(Standard
Operating Procedures). These explain what we do, when we do it and, often,
why we do it.

Migration from the Wiki:
==============

For each SOP:

1. Copy the content out of the wiki version into a text file.
  a good way to do this is to run:

  links -dump $url > filename.txt

2. Update or clean up any wording that should be cleaned up or changed.

3. Commit to new repo and push.

4. Change the wiki page to note that the SOP has been converted and redirect
to a    wiki page that explains about the git repo and how to access it and/or a
link to that  particular sop.
