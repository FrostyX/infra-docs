FedoraHosted Project Rename SOP

   This describes the steps necessary to rename a project in Fedora Hosted.

   Contents

     * 1 Rename the Trac instance
     * 2 Rename the git / svn / hg / ... directory
     * 3 Rename any old releases directories
     * 4 Rename the group in FAS

Rename the Trac instance

 cd /srv/web/trac/projects
 mv oldname newname
 cd newname/conf
 sed -i -e 's/oldname/newname/' trac.ini
 cd ..
 sudo -u apache trac-admin .
   resync

Rename the git / svn / hg / ... directory

 cd /git
 mv oldname.git newname.git

Rename any old releases directories

 cd /srv/web/releases/o/l/oldname
 (somehow, the newname releases dir gets created; if there were old releases, move them to the new location).

Rename the group in FAS

   Note
   Don't blindly rename
   fedorahosted groups are usually safe to rename. If the old group could be
   present in other apps/configs, though, (like provenpackagers, perl-sig,
   etc) do not rename them. The other apps would need to have the group name
   updated there as well to make this safe.

 ssh db2
 sudo -u postgres psql fas2
 BEGIN;
 select * from groups where name = '$OLDNAME';
 update groups set name = '$NEWNAME' where name = '$OLDNAME';
 -- Check that only one row was modified
 select * from groups where name in ('$OLDNAME', '$NEWNAME');
 -- Check that there's only one row and the name == $NEWNAME
 -- If incorrect, do ROLLBACK; instead of commit
 COMMIT;

   Warning
   Don't delete groups
   If, for some reason, you end up with a group in FAS that was a typo but it
   doesn't conflict with anything else, don't delete it without talking to
   other admins on fedora-infrastructure-list. The numeric group ids could be
   present on a filesystem somewhere and removing the group could eventually
   lead to the id being allocated to some other group which would give
   unintended people access to the files. As a group we can figure out what
   hosts and files need to be checked for this issue if a delete is needed.
