Purpose: Explain our use of various types of machines. 

== Introduction ==

This document explains what are various types of machines are used for in 
the life cycle of providing an application or resource. 

== Public Test machines ==

publictest instances are used for early investigation into a resource or application. 
At this stage the application might not be packaged yet, and we want to see if it's 
worth packaging and starting it on the process to be available in production. 
These machines are accessable to anyone in the sysadmin-test group, and coordination 
of use of instances is done on an ad-hock basis. These machines are re-installed 
every cycle cleanly, so all work must be saved before this occurs. 

== Development ==

These instances are for applications that are packaged and being investigated for 
deployment. Typically packages and config files are modified locally to get the 
application or resource working. No caching or proxies are used. Access is to a 
specific sysadmin group for that application or resource. These instances can 
be re-installed on request to 'start over' getting configration ready. 

== Staging ==

These instances are used to integrate the application or resource into puppet 
as well as proxy and caching setups. These instances should use puppet to deploy
all parts of the application or resource possible. Access to these instances 
is only to a sysadmin group for that application, who may or may not have sudo 
access. 

== Production == 

These instances are used to serve the ready for deployment application to the public. 
All changes are done via puppet and access is restricted. Changes should be done
here only after testing in staging.
