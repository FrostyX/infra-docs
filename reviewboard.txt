  Restarting

   After an update, to restart reviewboard just restart apache. Doing a
   service httpd stop and then a service httpd start should do it.

Create a new repository in ReviewBoard

  Creating a new git repository

    1. Enter the admin interface. If you have admin privilege, a link will be
       visible in the upper-right corner of the dashboard.
    2. In the admin dashboard click "Add" next to "Repositories"
    3. For the name, enter the Fedora Hosted project short name. (e.g. if the
       project is [53]https://fedorahosted.org/sssd, then the repository name
       should be sssd)
    4. "Show this repository" must be checked.
    5. Hosting service is "Custom"
    6. Repository type is Git
    7. Path should be /srv/git/project_short_name.git (e.g.
       /srv/git/sssd.git)
    8. Mirror path should be
       git://git.fedorahosted.org/git/project_short_name.git

          * Mirror path is used by client tools such as post-review to
            determine to which repository a submission belongs

    9. Raw file URL mask should be left blank
   10. Username and Password should both be left blank
   11. The bug tracker URL may vary from project to project, but if they are
       using the Fedora Hosted Trac bugtracker, it should be

          * Type: Trac
          * Bug Tracker URL: [54]https://fedorahosted.org/project_short_name
            (e.g. [55]https://fedorahosted.org/sssd)

   12. Do not set a Bug Tracker URL

  Creating a new bzr repository

    1. Go to the admin dashboard to [56]add a new repository.
    2. For the name, enter the Fedora Hosted project short name. (e.g. if the

       name should be kitchen)
    3. "Show this repository" must be checked.
    4. Hosting service is "Custom"
    5. Repository type is Bazaar
    6. Path should be /srv/git/project_short_name/branch_name (e.g.
       /srv/bzr/kitchen/devel) -- reviewboard doesn't understand how to work
       with repository conventions; it just works on branches.
    7. Mirror path should be
       bzr://bzr.fedorahosted.org/bzr/project_short_name/branch_name

          * Mirror path is used by client tools such as post-review to
            determine to which repository a submission belongs

    8. Username and Password should both be left blank
    9. The bug tracker URL may vary from project to project, but if they are
       using the Fedora Hosted Trac bugtracker, it should be

          * Type: Trac
          * Bug Tracker URL: [58]https://fedorahosted.org/project_short_name
            (e.g. [59]https://fedorahosted.org/kitchen)

   10. Do not set a Bug Tracker URL

  Create a default reviewer for a repository

   Reviews should be sent to the project development mailing list unless

          * Name: Something unique and sensible
          * File Regular Expression: enter '.*' (without the quotes)

               * This means that by default, the mailing list should receive
                 email for reviews of all files in the repository

    7. Under "Default groups", select the group you created above and click
       the arrow pointing right.
