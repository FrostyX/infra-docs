   Purpose: Denyhosts provides a protection against brute force attacks.

Description

   All of our servers now implement denyhosts to protect against brute force
   attacks. Very few boxes should be in the 'allowed' list. Especially
   internally.

Troubleshooting and Resolution

  Connection issues

   The most common issue will be legitimate logins failing. First, try to
   figure out why a host ended up on the deny list (tcptraceroute, failed
   login attempts, etc are all good candidates). Next do the following
   directions. The below example is for a host (10.0.0.1) being banned. Login
   to the box from a different host and as root do the following.

 cd /var/lib/denyhosts
 sed -si '/10.0.0.1/d' * /etc/hosts.deny
 /etc/init.d/denyhosts restart

   That should correct the problem.
