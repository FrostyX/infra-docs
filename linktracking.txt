Link tracking

   Using link tracking is [43]an easy way for us to find out how people are
   getting to our download page. People might click over to our download page
   from any of a number of areas, and knowing the relative usage of those
   links can help us understand what materials we're producing are more
   effective than others.

   Use these links for Fedora 14 release!
   The following links are pre-created for you to use in your posts.
   Right-click the link and choose "Copy link location," then paste the link
   in your media.

Adding links

   Each link should be constructed by adding ? to the URL, followed by a
   short code that includes:

     * an indicator for the link source (such as the wiki release notes)
     * an indicator for the Fedora release in specific (such as F15 for the
       final, or F15a for the Alpha test release)

   So a link to get.fp.o from the one-page release notes would become
   http://get.fedoraproject.org/?opF15.

FAQ

   I want to copy a link to my status update for social networking, or my
   blog.
           If you're posting a status update to identi.ca, for example, use
           the link tracking code for status updates. Don't copy a link
           straight from an announcement that includes link tracking from the
           announcement. You can copy the link itself but remember to change
           the portion after the ? to instead use the st code for status
           updates and blogs, followed by the Fedora release version (such as
           F16a, F16b, or F16), like this:
           http://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease?stF16a

   I want to point people to the announcement from my blog. Should I use the
   announcement link tracking code?
           The actual URL link itself is the announcement URL. Add the link
           tracking code for blogs, which would start with ?st and end with
           the Fedora release version, like this:
           http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/F16_release_announcement?stF16a
