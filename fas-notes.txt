Notes about FAS and how to do things in it:

- where are certs for fas accounts for koji, etc?
  on fas01 /var/lib/fedora-ca - makefile targets allow you to do
  things with them.
 
   look in index.txt for certs. One's marked with an 'R' in the left-most
   column are 'REVOKED'

   to revoke a cert:
    cd /var/lib/fedora-ca
    find the cert number in index.txt - the number is the 3rd column in the
    file - you can match it to the user by searching for their username. You
    want the highest number cert for their account.
     
    once you have the number you would run (as root or fas)

    make revoke cert=newcerts/$that_number.pem
