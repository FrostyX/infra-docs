Planet Subgroup Infrastructure SOP

   Fedora's planet infrastructure produces planet configs out of users'
   ~/.planet files in their homedirs on fedorapeople.org. You can also create
   subgroups of users into other planets. This document explains how to setup
   new subgroups.

   Owner: Fedora Infrastructure Team

   Contact: #fedora-admin

   Servers: puppet1 / planet.fedoraproject.org

   Purpose: provide easy setup of new planet groups on
   planet.fedoraproject.org

   After you get a request for a new planet group you just need to do the
   following:

The Setup

    1. on puppet1 cp -a configs/system/planet/grouptmpl
       configs/system/planet/newgroupname
    2. cd to the new directory
    3. run perl -pi -e "s/%%groupname/newgroupname/g" fpbuilder.conf
       base_config planet-group.cron templates/* replacing newgroupname with
       the groupname you want
    4. git add the whole dir
    5. edit manifests/services/planet.pp
    6. copy and paste everything from begging to end of the design team group
    7. modify what you copied replacing design with the new group name
    8. save it
    9. check everything in
   10. run puppet on planet and check if it works

Use

   Tell the requester to then copy their current .planet file to
   .planet.newgroupname. For example with the design team:

 cp ~/.planet ~/.planet.design

   This will then show up on the new feed -
   http://planet.fedoraproject.org/design/
