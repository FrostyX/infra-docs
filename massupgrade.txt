   Every once in a while, we need to apply mass upgrades to our servers for
   various security and other upgrades.

Contact Information

   Owner: Fedora Infrastructure Team

   Contact: #fedora-admin, sysadmin-main,
   infrastructure@lists.fedoraproject.org, #fedora-noc

   Location: All over the world.

   Servers: all

   Purpose: Apply kernel/other upgrades to all of our servers

Preparation

    1. Determine which host group you are going to be doing updates/reboots
       on.

         Group "A" are servers that end users will see or note being down
         and anything that depends on them.

         Group "B" are servers that contributors will see or note being
         down and anything that depends on them.

         Group "C" are servers that infrastructure will notice are down,
         or are redundent enough to reboot some with others taking the
         load.

    2. Appoint an 'Update Leader' for the updates.
    3. Follow the [61]Outage Infrastructure SOP and send advance notification
       to the appropriate lists. Try to schedule the update at a time when
       many admins are around to help/watch for problems and when impact for
       the group affected is less. Do NOT do multiple groups on the same day
       if possible.
    4. Plan an order for rebooting the machines considering two factors:

          * Location of systems on the kvm or xen hosts. [You will normally
            reboot all systems on a host together]
          * Impact of systems going down on other services, operations and
            users. Thus since the database servers and nfs servers are the
            backbone of many other systems, they and systems that are on the
            same xen boxes would be rebooted before other boxes.

    5. To aid in organizing a mass upgrade/reboot with many people helping,
       it may help to create a checklist of machines in a gobby document.
    6. Schedule downtime in nagios.
    7. Make doubly sure that various app owners are aware of the reboots

Staging

   Any updates that can be tested in staging or a pre-production environment
   should be tested there first. Including new kernels, updates to core
   database applications / libraries. Web applications, libraries, etc.

Special Considerations

   While this may not be a complete list, here are some special things that
   must be taken into account before rebooting certain systems:

  Disable builders

   Before the following machines are rebooted, all koji builders should be
   disabled and all running jobs allowed to complete:

     * db04
     * nfs01
     * kojipkgs02

   Builders can be removed from koji, updated and re-added. Use:

 koji disable-host NAME

   and

 koji enable-host NAME

   (note: you must be a koji admin).

  Post reboot action

   The following machines require post-boot actions (mostly entering
   passphrases). Make sure admins that have the passphrases are on hand for
   the reboot:

     * backup-2 (LUKS passphrase on boot)
     * sign-vault01 (NSS passphrase for sigul service)
     * sign-bridge01 (NSS passphrase for sigul bridge service)

  Schedule autoqa01 reboot

   There is currently an autoqa01.c host on cnode01. Check with QA folks
   before rebooting this guest/host.

  Bastion01 and Bastion02 and openvpn server

   We need one of the bastion machines to be up to provide openvpn for all
   machines. Before rebooting bastion02, modify:
   manifests/nodes/bastion0*.phx2.fedoraproject.org.pp files to start openvpn
   server on bastion01, wait for all clients to re-connect, reboot bastion02
   and then revert back to it as openvpn hub.

  Special yum directives

   Sometimes we will wish to exclude or otherwise modify the yum.conf on a
   machine. For this purpose, all machines have an include, making them read
   [62]http://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/infra/hosts/FQHN/yum.conf.include
   from the infrastructure repo. If you need to make such changes, add them
   to the infrastructure repo before doing updates.

Update Leader

   Each update should have a Leader appointed. This person will be in charge
   of doing any read-write operations, and delegating to others to do tasks.
   If you aren't specficially asked by the Leader to reboot or change
   something, please don't. The Leader will assign out machine groups to
   reboot, or ask specific people to look at machines that didn't come back
   up from reboot or aren't working right after reboot. It's important to
   avoid multiple people operating on a single machine in a read-write manner
   and interfering with changes.

Group A reboots

   Group A machines are end user critical ones. Outages here should be
   planned at least a week in advance and announced to the announce list.

Doing the upgrade

   If possible, system upgrades should be done in advance of the reboot (with
   relevant testing of new packages on staging). To do the upgrades, make
   sure that the Infrastructure RHEL repo is updated as necessary to pull in
   the new packages ([63]Infrastructure Yum Repo SOP)

   On lockbox01, as root run:

 func-yum [--host=hostname] update

   --host can be specified multiple times and takes wildcards.

   pinging people as necessary if you are unsure about any packages.

   Additionally you can see which machines still need rebooted with:

 sudo func-command --timeout=10 --oneline /usr/local/bin/needs-reboot.py | grep yes

   You can also see which machines would need a reboot if updates were all
   applied with:

 sudo func-command --timeout=10 --oneline /usr/local/bin/needs-reboot.py after-updates | grep yes

Doing the reboot

   In the order determined above, reboots will usually be grouped by the
   virtualization hosts that the servers are on. You can see the guests per
   virt host on lockbox01 in /var/log/virthost-lists.out

   To reboot sets of boxes based on which virthost they are we've written a special
   script which facilitates it:

   func-vhost-reboot virthost-fqdn

   ex:

sudo func-vhost-reboot virthost13.phx2.fedoraproject.org

Aftermath

    1. Make sure that everything's running fine
    2. Reenable nagios notification as needed
    3. Make sure to perform any manual post-boot setup (such as entering
       passphrases for encrypted volumes)
    4. Close outage ticket.


Non virthost reboots:
   If you need to reboot specific hosts and make sure they recover - consider using:

sudo func-host-reboot hostname hostname1 hostname2 ...

   If you want to reboot the hosts one at a time waiting for each to come back before rebooting the next
   pass a -o to func-host-reboot.
