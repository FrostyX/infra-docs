   On backend should run copr-backend service (which spawns 3 processes).
   Backend spawns VM from Fedora Cloud. You could not login to those machines directly.
   You have to:
   ssh root@copr-be-dev.cloud.fedoraproject.org
   su - copr
   . /home/copr/cloud/ec2rc.sh
   euca-describe-instances
   # instance type m1.builder are those spawned by backend, check 18th column with internal IP
   # log there if you want
   ssh root@172.16.3.3
   # or terminate that instance (ID is in 2nd column)
   euca-terminate-instances i-000003b3
