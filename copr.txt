Deploy informations:
   Using playbooks and rbac:

   On backend should run copr-backend service (which spawns several processes).
   Backend spawns VM from Fedora Cloud. You could not login to those machines directly.
   You have to:
   ssh root@copr-be.cloud.fedoraproject.org
   su - copr
   source /home/copr/cloud/ec2rc.sh
   euca-describe-instances
   # instance type m1.builder are those spawned by backend, check 18th column with internal IP
   # log there if you want
   ssh root@172.16.3.3
   # or terminate that instance (ID is in 2nd column)
   euca-terminate-instances i-000003b3
   # you can delete all instances in error state or simply forgotten by:
   /home/copr/delete-forgotten-instances.pl
