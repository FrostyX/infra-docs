Setting up an infrastructure git repo - and the push mechanisms for the
magicks

We have a number of git repos (in /git on lockbox) that manage files
for puppet, our docs, our common host info database and our kickstarts
This is a doc on how to setup a new one of these, if it is needed.

Steps:

make $git_dir
setfacl -m d:g:$yourgroup:rwx -m d:g:$othergroup:rwx  \
        -m g:$yourgroup:rwx -m g:$othergroup:rwx  \
        $git_dir

cd $git_dir
git init --bare


edit up config - add these lines to the bottom:

[hooks]
                  # (normallysysadmin-members@fedoraproject.org)
    mailinglist = emailaddress@yourdomain.org 
    emailprefix = 
    maildomain = fedoraproject.org
    reposource = /path/to/this/dir
    repodest = /path/to/where/you/want/the/files/dumped


edit up description - make it something useful.

cd hooks
rm -f *.sample
cp hooks from /git/infra-docs/hooks/ on lockbox01 to this path

modify sudoers to allow users in whatever groups can commit to 
this repo can run /usr/local/bin/syncgittree.sh w/o inputting a password
