Notes/FAQ on using libvirt/virsh/virt-manager in our environment

Q. how do I migrate a guest from one virthost to another:
 
A. multiple steps:
   1. setup an unpassworded root ssh key to allow communication between 
      the two virthosts as root. This is only temporary, so, while scary
      it is not a big deal. Right now, this also means modifying 
      the /etc/ssh/sshd_config to permitroot without-password.

   2. setup storage on the destination end to match the source storage.
     If the path to the storage is not the same on both systems
      (ie: not the same path into /dev/Guests00/myguest) then take a copy
     of the guest xml file from /etc/libvirt/qemu and modify it so it has 
     the right path. If you need to do this you need to add --xml thisfile.xml
     to the arguments below AFTER the word 'migrate'
  
   3. as root on source location: 
      virsh -c qemu:///system  migrate --p2p --tunnelled \
             --copy-storage-all myguest \
             qemu+ssh://root@destinationvirthost/system

   This should start the migration process and it will output absolutely 
   jack-squat on the cli for you to know this. On the destination system 
   go look in /var/log/libvirt/qemu/myguest.log (tail -f will show you the 
   progress results as a percentage completed)
    
   notes --p2p and --tunnelled are so it goes direct from one host to the other
   but uses ssh.
