  Purpose:      Have a nice landing page for all our webapps.

Description
-----------

  We have a number of webapps, many of which our users don't know about.  This
  page was created so there was a central place where users could stumble
  through them and learn.

  The page is generated by a puppet module in puppet/modules/apps-fp-o.
  It makes use of an RPM package, the source code for which is at
  https://github.com/fedora-infra/apps.fp.o

  You can update the page by updating the apps.yaml file in that puppet
  module.

  When puppet is run next, the two ``exec`` statements should pick up your
  changes and regenerate the static html and json data for the page.
