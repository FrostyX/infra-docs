   Servers: hosted1

   Purpose: Provides for users only viewing tickets they are involved with.

Description

   Fedora Hosted Projects have the option of setting ticket permissions so
   that only users involved with tickets can see them. This plugin requires
   someone in sysadmin-hosted to set it up, and requires justification to
   use. The only current implementation is a request tracking system at
   [45]https://fedorahosted.org/famnarequests for tracking requests for North
   American ambassadors since mailing addresses, etc will be put in there.

Implementation

   On hosted1:

     * sudo -u apache vim /srv/web/trac/projects/<project name>/conf/trac.ini

   Add the following to the appropriate sections of trac.ini

     [privatetickets]
     group_blacklist = anonymous, authenticated

     [components]
     privatetickets.* = enabled

     [trac]
     permission_policies = PrivateTicketsPolicy, DefaultPermissionPolicy, LegacyAttachmentPolicy

   Note that for projects not currently using plugins, you'll have to add the
   [components] section, and you'll need to add the permission_policies to
   the [trac] section.

   Next, someone with TRAC_ADMIN needs to grant TICKET_VIEW_SELF (a new
   permission) to authenticated. This permission allows users to view tickets
   that they are either owner, CC, or reporter on. There are other options
   more fully described at [46]the upstream site.

   Make sure that TICKET_VIEW is removed from anonymous, or else this plugin
   will have no effect.
