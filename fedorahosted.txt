Fedorahosted Infrastructure SOP

   Provide hosting place for open source projects

Contact Information

   Owner: Fedora Infrastructure Team

   Contact: #fedora-admin, sysadmin-hosted

   Location: Serverbeach

   Servers: hosted03, hosted04

   Purpose: Provide hosting place for open source projects

Description

   fedorahosted.org can be used to host open source projects. It provides the
   following facilities:

    1. An scm for maintaining the code. The currently supported scm's include
       Mercurial, Git, Bazaar, or SVN. Note: There is no cvs
    2. A trac instance, which provides a mini-wiki for hosting information
       and also provides a ticketing system.
    3. A mailing list

How to setup a new hosted project

   Important
   This page is for administrators only. People wishing to request a hosted
   project should use the Ticketing System ; see the
   new project request template. (Requires Fedora Account)

    1. Create source group in Fedora Account System (<scm><project>
       should be the group name (ex gitepel, svnkernel, etc))
    2. Create source repo <see hosted repository setup SOP>
    3. Log into hosted03
    4. Create new project space:

 $ sudo /usr/local/bin/hosted-setup.sh <project name> <project admin> <scm type>

                       * <project name> must use the same case as the scm
                         repo
                       * You're likely to end up with 'Command failed:
                         columns username, action are not unique' - this can
                         be safely ignored as this only tries to tell you
                         that you are giving admin access to a person already
                         having admin access

    5. If a mailing list is desired:

                    follow the directions for the mailman SOP

How to import data from a cvs repo into git repo

   Often users request their git repos to be imported from an existing cvs
   repo. This is a two step process as follows:

 git-cvsimport -v -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fedoraproject.org/cvs/docs -C <dir> <cvs_module>

 sudo git clone --bare --no-hardlinks </pathto/cvsimported/repo> /git/<git_dir>.git/

   Example:

 git-cvsimport -v -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.fedoraproject.org/cvs/docs -C translation-quick-start-guide translation-quick-start-guide
 sudo git clone --bare --no-hardlinks translation-quick-start-guide/ /git/translation-quick-start-guide.git/

Git notes

   Note that our git repos disallow non-fast-forward pushes by default. This
   default makes the most sense, but sometimes, users understand the impact
   of doing so, but still wish to make such a push.

   To enable this temporarily, edit the config file inside of the git repo,
   and make sure that receive.denyNonFastforwards is set to false. Make sure
   to reenable this once the user has finished their push.

How to allow a project to redirect parts of their release tree

   A project may want to host parts of their release tree elsewhere (for
   instance, moving docs from hosting inside of the fedorhosted release tree
   to an external service).  To do that, modify:

      configs/web/fedorahosted.org/release.conf

   Adding a new Directory section like this:

      # Allow python-fedora project to redirect documentation/release tree elsewhere 
      <Directory /srv/web/releases/p/y/python-fedora>
      AllowOverride FileInfo
      </Directory>

  Then tell the project that they can create a .htaccess file with the
  Redirect (Note that the release tree can be reached by two URLs so you need to
  redirect both of them):

     Redirect permanent /releases/p/y/python-fedora/doc http://pythonhosted.org/python-fedora
     Redirect permanent /released/python-fedora/doc/ http://pythonhosted.org/python-fedora
