   Owner: sysadmin-main

   Location: PHX2

   Servers: All PHX2 and VPN Fedora machines

   Purpose: Access via ssh to Fedora project machines.

  Introduction

   This page will contain some useful instructions about how you can safely
   login into Fedora PHX2 machines successfully using a public key
   authentication. As of 2011-05-27, all machines require a SSH key to
   access. Password authentication will no longer work. Note that this SOP
   has nothing to do with actually gaining access to specific machines. For
   that you MUST be in the correct group for shell access to that machine.
   This SOP simply describes the process once you do have valid and
   appropriate shell access to a machine.

  SSH configuration

   First of all: (on your local machine)

 nano ~/.ssh/config

   NOTE: This file needs to be chmod 600, or you will get a "Bad owner or
   permissions" error. The .ssh directorymust be mode 700. 

   then, add the following:

<snip here>
 Host bastion.fedoraproject.org
     ProxyCommand none
     ForwardAgent no
 Host *.phx2.fedoraproject.org *.qa.fedoraproject.org 10.5.125.* 10.5.126.* 10.5.127.* *.vpn.fedoraproject.org
     User FAS_USERNAME
     ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p bastion.fedoraproject.org
<snip here>

   One slight annoyance with this method is that you must include the
   .phx2.fedoraproject.org part when you SSH to Fedora machines in order for
   the connection to be tunneled through bastion.

   To avoid this You can add aliases for each of the Fedora machines you login to by
   modifying the second Host line:

 Host *.phx2.fedoraproject.org 10.5.125.* 10.5.126.* 10.5.127.* *.vpn.fedoraproject.org puppet01 noc01 # list all hosts here

  SSH Agent forwarding

   You should normally have:

 ForwardAgent no

   For Fedora hosts (this is the default in OpenSSH). You can override this
   on a per-session basis by using '-A' with ssh. SSH agents could be misused
   if you connect to a compromised host with forwarding on (the attacker can
   use your agent to authenticate them to anything you have access to as long
   as you are logged in). Additionally, if you do need SSH agent forwarding
   (say for copying files between machines), you should remember to logout as
   soon as you are done to not leave your agent exposed.

  Troubleshooting:

     * 'channel 0: open failed: administratively prohibited: open failed': If
       you receive this message for a machine proxied through bastion, then
       bastion was unable to connect to the host. This most likely means that
       tried to SSH to a nonexistent machine. You can debug this by trying to
       connect to that machine from bastion.
     * if your local username is different from the one registered in FAS,
       please remember to set up a User variable (like above) where you
       specify your FAS username. If that's missing SSH will try to login by
       using your local username, thus it will fail.
     * ssh -vv is very handy for debugging what sections are matching and
       what are not.
     * If you get access denied several times in a row, please consult with
       #fedora-admin. If you try too many times with an invalid config your
       IP could be added to denyhosts.
     * If you are running an OpenSSH version less than 5.4, then the -W
       option is not avaliable. In that case, use the following ProxyCommand
       line instead:

 ProxyCommand ssh -q bastion.fedoraproject.org exec nc %h %p
