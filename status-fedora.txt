Fedora Status Service - SOP
===========================

     Fedora-Status is the software that generates the page at
    http://status.fedoraproject.org/. This page should be kept
    up to date with the current status of the services ran by
    Fedora Infrastructure.
     This page is hosted at an OpenShift instance available at
    http://status-fedora1.rhcloud.com/ (status.fp.o is an alias).
     The upstream repository is fedora-status on FedoraHosted.org.

Contact Information
-------------------

    Owner:     Fedora Infrastructure Team
    Contact:   #fedora-admin, #fedora-noc
    Servers:   An OpenShift instance
    Purpose:   Give status information to users about the current
                status of our public services.
    Upstream:  http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/fedora-status.git

How it works
------------
 To keep this website as stable as can be, the page is
generated at the time of upload by OpenShift.
 As soon as you push to the OpenShift repo, a build hook
will create the HTML page.

Updating the page
-----------------
 1. Check out the repo at
ssh://bab5ba6eb9b94f2083fdeefc5e87309b@status-fedora2.rhcloud.com/~/git/status.git/

(old repo is at: ssh://1aa9e6a413c546b29736adca52b46dff@status-fedora1.rhcloud.com/~/git/status.git/ )
 2. cd status
 3. Run ./manage.py

Usage of manage.py
------------------
 manage.py has three positional arguments: <service> <new_status> <new_message>.
 service is the service you want to modify the visible status of, this is one
of the names in the right side of a  block on the status page, when you want
to update all services at once, just let this be "-".
 new_status should be "good", "minor" or "major", and will be the new
status for the given service(s).
 new_message is the message to detail the status in the box, you can also
let this be "-" to use "Everything seems to be working."
 manage.py also has an optional argument --general-info, which will
update the text in the bar under the global status.
