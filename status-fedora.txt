Fedora Status Service - SOP
===========================

     Fedora-Status is the software that generates the page at
    http://status.fedoraproject.org/. This page should be kept
    up to date with the current status of the services ran by
    Fedora Infrastructure.
     This page is hosted at an OpenShift instance available at
    http://status-fedora1.rhcloud.com/ (status.fp.o is an alias).
     The upstream repository is fedora-status on FedoraHosted.org.

Contact Information
-------------------

    Owner:     Fedora Infrastructure Team
    Contact:   #fedora-admin, #fedora-noc
    Servers:   An OpenShift instance
    Purpose:   Give status information to users about the current
                status of our public services.

How it works
------------
 To keep this website as stable as can be, the page is
generated at the time of upload by OpenShift.
 As soon as you push to the OpenShift repo, a build hook
will create the HTML page.

Updating the page
-----------------
 To update the status at http://status.fedoraproject.org/, you
should first checkout the OpenShift git repo available at:
    ssh://1aa9e6a413c546b29736adca52b46dff@status-fedora1.rhcloud.com/~/git/status.git/
 For this to work, your ssh key must have been added to OpenShift.
 After the checkout, cd to the status directory.
 To change the status of any service, use the ./manage.py command,
this will pull the repo (so you are modifying the latest version),
update the statuses.json file, git commit the statuses.json file,
and finally it will push the new status to OpenShift, which will then
update the static html file service to the users.

Usage of manage.py
------------------
 manage.py has three positional arguments: <service> <new_status> <new_message>.
 service is the service you want to modify the visible status of, this is one
of the names in the right side of a  block on the status page, when you want
to update all services at once, just let this be "-".
 new_status should be "good", "minor" or "major", and will be the new
status for the given service(s).
 new_message is the message to detail the status in the box, you can also
let this be "-" to use "Everything seems to be working."
 manage.py also has an optional argument --general-info, which will
update the text in the bar under the global status.
