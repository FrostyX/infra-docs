Introduction

   This wiki page will help any sysadmin having a [50]Fedora Hosted Project
   completely removed either because the owner requested to have it removed
   or for whatever any other issue that would take us to remove a project.
   This page covers git, Trac, Mailing List and FAS group clean-up.

Our first move

   If you are going to remove a Fedora Hosted's project, please remember to
   create a folder into /srv/tmp that should follow the following syntax:

 cd /srv/tmp && mkdir $project-hold-until-xx-xx-xx

   where xx-xx-xx should be substituted with the date everything should be
   purged away from there. (it happens 14 days after the delete request)

Removing Project's git repo

   Having a git repository removed can be achieved with the following steps:

 ssh uid@fedorahosted.org
 cd /git
 mv $project.git/ /srv/tmp/$project-hold-until-xx-xx-xx/

   We're done with git!

Removing Trac's project

   Steps are:

 ssh uid@fedorahosted.org
 cd /srv/web/trac/projects
 mv $project/ /srv/tmp/$project-hold-until-xx-xx-xx/

   and...that's all!

Removing Project's ML

   We have two options here:

   Delete a list, but keep the archives

 sudo /usr/lib/mailman/bin/rmlist <listname>

   Delete a list and its archives

 sudo /usr/lib/mailman/bin/rmlist -a <listname>

   If you are going to completely remove the Mailing List and its archives,
   please make sure the list is empty and there are no subscribers in it.

FAS Group Removal

   Not every Fedora sysadmin can have this done. See
   [51]ISOP:ACCOUNT_DELETION for information. You may want to remove the
   group or simply disable it.
