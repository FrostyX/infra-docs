Infrastructure SOP SOP

   We use SOPs (standard operating procedures) to list how we run things in
   Fedora. A better explanation and a list of SOPs is available at
   Category:Infrastructure SOPs.

   Use the same "Contact Information" section on all SOPs. Past that,
   sections vary as needed.

SOP naming

   SOP page names should use spaces/underscores and not use subpages, as per
   the wiki standard. SOPs need not have "Infrastructure" in their title.
   Describe the service and end the page name with "SOP".

Stuff every SOP should have

  Header

   At the top of the wiki page, include the following two lines:

 {{header|infra}}
 {{shortcut|ISOP:NAME}}

Create the shortcut

   After saving the page the first time, create the shortcut. The shortcut is
   just a redirect to the original page. Click the red link in the "Shortcut"
   box at the top of your new page and save it with this line:

 #REDIRECT [[New SOP page name]]

   Obviously, replace New SOP page name with the name of your new SOP's page.
