Infrastructure SOP SOP

   We use SOPs (standard operating procedures) to list how we run things in
   Fedora. A better explanation is available in REDAME file.
   A list of SOPs is available at
   http://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/infra/docs/

   Use the same "Contact Information" section on all SOPs. Past that,
   sections vary as needed.
