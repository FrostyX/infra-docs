IBM RSA II Infrastructure SOP

   Many of our physical machines use RSA II cards for remote management.

Contact Information

   Owner: Fedora Infrastructure Team
   Contact: #fedora-admin, sysadmin-main
   Location: PHX, ibiblio
   Servers: All physical IBM machines
   Purpose: Provide remote management for our physical IBM machines

Restarting the RSA II card

   Normally, the RSA II can be restarted from the web/ssh interface. If you
   are locked out of any outside access to the RSA II, follow these
   instructions on the physical machine.

   If the machine can be rebooted without issue, cut off all power to the
   machine, wait a few seconds, and restart everything.

   Otherwise, to restart the card without rebooting the machine:

    1. Download and install the IBM Remote Supervisor Adapter II Daemon

         1. yum install usbutils libusb-devel # (needed by the RSA II daemon)
         2. Download the correct tarball from
            http://www-947.ibm.com/systems/support/supportsite.wss/docdisplay?lndocid=MIGR-5071676&brandind=5000008
            (TODO: check if this can be packaged in Fedora)
         3. Extract the tarball and run "sudo ./install.sh --update"

    1. Download and extract the IBM Advanced Settings Utility
       (http://www-947.ibm.com/systems/support/supportsite.wss/docdisplay?lndocid=TOOL-ASU&brandind=5000016, warning: this tarball dumps files in the current working directory)

    2. Issue a "sudo ./asu64 rebootrsa" to reboot the RSA II.

    3. Clean up: "yum remove ibmusbasm64"
