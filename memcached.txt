Memcached Infrastructure SOP

   Our memcached setup is currently only used for wiki sessions. With
   mediawiki, sessions stored in files over NFS or in the DB are very slow.
   Memcached is a non-blocking solution for our session storage.

Contact Information

   Owner: Fedora Infrastructure Team

   Contact: #fedora-admin, sysadmin-main, sysadmin-web groups

   Location: PHX

   Servers: memcached03, memcached04

   Purpose: Provide caching for Fedora web applications.

Checking Status

   Our memcached instances are currently firewalled to only allow access from
   wiki application servers. To check the status of an instance, use:

 echo stats | nc memcached0{3,4} 11211

   from an allowed host.


Flushing Memcached

   Sometimes, wrong contents get cached, and the cache should be flushed.
   To do this, use:

 echo flush_all | nc memcached0{3,4} 11211

   from an allowed host.


Restarting Memcached

   Note that restarting an memcached instance will drop all sessions stored
   on that instance. As mediawiki uses hashing to distribute sessions across
   multiple instances, restarting one out of two instances will result in
   about half of the total sessions being dropped.

   To restart memcached:

 sudo /etc/init.d/memcached restart

Configuring Memcached

   Memcached is currently setup as a module in the puppet git repo. The main
   two tunables are the MAXCONN (the maximum number of concurrent
   connections) and CACHESIZE (the amount memory to use for storage). These
   variables can be set through $memcached_maxconn and $memcached_cachesize
   in puppet. Additionally, other options (as described in the memcached
   manpage) can be set via $memcached_options.
