Contact Information

   Owner: Fedora Infrastructure Team

   Contact: #fedora-admin

   Location: Phoenix

   Servers: value03

   Purpose: Provides our IRC bot

Description

   zodbot is a supybot based irc bot that we use in our #fedora channels.
   It runs on value03 as the daemon user. We do not config manage the
   zodbot.conf because supybot makes changes to it on its own. Therefore it
   gets backed up and is treated as data.

shutdown

  killall supybot

startup

 cd /srv/web/meetbot # zodbot current needs to be started in the meetbot directory.
                     # This requirement will go away in a later meetbot release.
 sudo -u daemon supybot -d /var/lib/zodbot/conf/zodbot.conf

Startup issues

  If the bot won't connect, with an error like:

    "Nick/channel is temporarily unavailable"

  found in /var/lib/zodbot/logs/messages.log, hop on Freenode (with your own
  IRC client) and do the following:
  
  /msg nickserv release zodbot [the password]

  The password can be found on the bot's host in
  /var/lib/zodbot/conf/zodbot.conf

  This should allow the bot to connect again.

Processing interrupted meeting logs

   zodbot forgets about meetings if they are in progress when the bot goes
   down; therefore, the meetings never get processed. Users may request a
   ticket in [52]our Trac instance to have meeting logs processed.

   Trac tickets for meeting log processing should consist of a URL where
   zodbot had saved the log so far and an uploaded file containing the rest
   of the log. The logs are stored in /srv/web/meetbot. Append the remainder
   of the log uploaded to Trac (don't worry too much about formatting;
   meeting.py works well with irssi- and XChat-like logs), then run:

 sudo python /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/supybot/plugins/MeetBot/meeting.py replay /path/to/fixed.log.txt

   Close the Trac ticket, letting the user know that the logs are processed
   in the same directory as the URL they gave you.

Becoming an admin

   Register with zodbot on IRC.

 /msg zodbot misc help register

   You have to identify to the bot to do any admin type commands, and you
   need to have done so before anyone can give you privs.

   After doing this, ask in #fedora-admin on IRC and someone will grant you
   privs if you need them. You'll likely be added to the admin group, which
   has the following capabilities (the below snippet is from an IRC log
   illustrating how to get the list of capabilities).

 21:57 < nirik> .list admin
 21:57 < zodbot> nirik: capability add, capability remove, channels, ignore add,
 ignore list, ignore remove, join, nick, and part
