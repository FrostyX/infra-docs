Contact Information

   Owner: Fedora Infrastructure Team

   Contact: #fedora-admin

   Location: freenode

   Servers: none

   Purpose: Provides a channel for Fedora contributors to use.

Is a new channel needed?

   First you should see if one of the existing Fedora channels will meet your
   needs. Adding a new channel can give you a less noisy place to focus on
   something, but at the cost of less people being involved. If you
   topic/area is development related, perhaps the main #fedora-devel channel
   will meet your needs?

Adding new channel

     * Make sure the channel is in the #fedora-* namespace. This allows the
       Fedora Group Coordinator to make changes to it if needed.

     * Found the channel. You do this by /join #channelname, then /msg
       chanserv register #channelname

     * Setup GUARD mode. This allows ChanServ to be in the channel for easier
       management: /msg chanserv set #channel GUARD on

     * Add Some other Operators/Managers to the access list. This would allow
       them to manage the channel if you are asleep or absent.

   /msg chanserv access #channel add NICK +ARfiorstv

You can see what the various flags mean at:

   You may want to consider adding some or all of the folks in #fedora-ops
   who manage other channels to help you with yours. You can see this list
   with /msg chanserv access #fedora-ops list

     * Set default modes. /msg chanserv set mlock #channel +Ccnt (The t for
       topic lock is optional if your channel would like to have people
       change the topic often).

     * If your channel is of general interest, add it to the main communicate
       page of IRC Channels, and possibly announce it to your target
       audience.

     * You may want to request zodbot join your channel if you need it's
       functions. You can request that in #fedora-admin.

Recovering/fixing an existing channel

     * If there is an existing channel in the #fedora-* namespace that has a
       missing founder/operator, please contact the Fedora Group Coordinator:
       [49]User:Spot and request it be reassigned. Follow the above procedure
       on the channel once done so it's setup and has enough
       operators/managers to not need reassiging again.
