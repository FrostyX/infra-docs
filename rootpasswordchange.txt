RootPasswordChange SOP

Changing root passwords globally and with haste

     * Create a file in /root on puppet1 named thatfile
     * contents should be:

 root:SHA-encrypted-form-of-new-password

   NB: don't name the file newpassword or things go weird on puppet1 :)

 func-sendfile /root/thatfile /root/newpassword

   NB: func-sendfile should be in /usr/local/bin - shortly - it sadly outputs
   very poorly as to what it is doing - something that skvidal is working on.

 func-command 'cat /root/newpassword | /usr/sbin/chpasswd -e'

 func-command 'rm -f /root/newpassword'
