Torrent Release

   When you want to add a new torrent to the tracker at
   [46]http://torrent.fedoraproject.org you need to take the following steps
   to have it listed correctly:

    1. login to torrent.fedoraproject.org. If you are unable to do so please
       contact the fedora infrastructure group about access. This procedure
       requires membership in the torrentadmin group.
    2. upload the files you want to add to the torrent to
       torrent.fedoraproject.org:/srv/torrent/new/$yourOrg/
    3. use sha1sum and verify the file you have uploaded matches the source
    4. organize the files into subdirs (or not) as you would like
    5. run /srv/torrent/new/maketorrent [file-or-dir-to-torrent]
       ([file-or-dir-to-torrent]) to generate a .torrent file or files
    6. copy the .torrent file(s) to: /srv/torrent/www/torrents/$yourOrg/
    7. cd to /srv/torrent/torrent-generator/ or /srv/torrent/spins-generator/
       (depending on if it is an official release or spins release)
    8. add a .ini file in this directory for the content you'll be
       torrenting. If you're not doing a normal Fedora release the filename
       should in the brackets should be [$yourOrg/File-Of-1.1.torrent] — the
       format of each section should be as follows:
       [Zod-livecd-1-i386.torrent]
       description=Fedora Core 6 Zod LiveCD 1 iso image for i386.
       size=683M
       releasedate=2006-12-22
       group=Fedora Core 6 Zod LiveCD 1
    9. mv all files from /srv/torrent/new/$yourOrg into
       /srv/torrent/btholding/ - this includes the files you uploaded as well
       as the .torrent files you've created.

   Your files will be linked on the website and available on the tracker
   after this.
