1. Contact Information
-----------------------

    Owner: Fedora Infrastructure Team
    Contact: #fedora-admin
    Persons: athmane herlo
    Sponsor: nirik
    Location: phx2
    Servers: paste01.stg, paste01.dev
    Purpose: To host Fedora Pastebin


2. Introduction
----------------

Fedora pastebin is powered by sticky-notes which is included in EPEL. 

Fedora theming (skin) is included in puppet module.


3. Installation
----------------

Sticky-notes needs a MySQL db and a user with 'select, update, delete, insert' privileges.

It's recommended to dump and import db from a working installation 
to save time (skipping the installation and tweaking).

By default the installation is locked ie: you can't relaunch it.

However, you can unlock the installation by commenting the line containing
'$gsod->trigger' in '/etc/sticky-notes/install.php' then pointing the web browser to '/install'

The configuration file containing general settings and DB credentials 
is located in '/etc/sticky-notes/config.php'

4. Dashboard
-------------

Sticky-notes has a dashboard (URL: /admin/) that can be used to :

    - Manage pastes: 
        -- deleting paste
        -- getting information about the paste author (IP/Date/time etc...)
    - Manage users (aka admins) which can log into the dashboard
    - Manage IP Bans (add / delete banned IPs).
    - Authentication (not needed)
    - Site configuration: 
        -- General configuration (included in config.php).
        -- Project Honey Pot configuration (not a FOSS service)
        -- Word censor configuration: a list of words to be censored in pastes. 

5. Add a word to censored list
------------------------------

If a word is in censored list, any paste containing that word will be
rejected, to add one, edit the variable '$sg_censor' in sticky-notes configuration file.

$sg_censor = "WORD1
WORD2
...
...
WORDn";
