Add a new Fedora release
========================

* Login

* On the front page, in the menu on the left side, if there is a `Fedora
  Rawhide` release, click on `(edit)`.

* Bump the `Release number` on `Fedora Rawhide` to avoid conflicts with the new
  release you're creating

* Back on the index page, click on `New release`

* Complete the form:

  Release number
    This would be the integer version of the Fedora release, for example 24 for
    Fedora 24.

  Support
    The current status of the Fedora release
    - Rawhide for Fedora Rawhide
    - Test for branched release
    - Release for released Fedora
    - Retired for retired release of Fedora


Upload new test results
=======================

The kernel tests are available on the `kernel-test
<https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/kernel-tests.git/>`_ git repository.

Once ran with `runtests.sh`, you can upload the resulting file either using
`fedora_submit.py` or the UI.

If you choose the UI the steps are simply:

* Login

* Click on `Upload` in the main menu on the top

* Select the result file generated by running the tests

* Submit
