Description
-----------

  fmn is a pair of systems intended to route fedmsg notifications to Fedora
  contributors and users.

  There is a web interface running on notifs-web01 and notifs-web02 that
  allows users to login and configure their preferences to select this or that
  type of message.  

  There is a backend running on notifs-backend01 where most of the work is
  done.

  The backend process is a 'fedmsg-hub' daemon, controlled by systemd.
 
  Restart:

    $ sudo systemctl restart fedmsg-hub

  Watch logs:

    $ sudo journalctl -u fedmsg-hub -f

  Configuration:

    $ ls /etc/fedmsg.d/
    $ sudo fedmsg-config | less
