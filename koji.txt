Koji Infrastructure SOP

   Note
   We are transitioning from two buildsystems, koji for Fedora and plague for
   EPEL, to just using koji. This page documents both.

   Koji and plague are our buildsystems. They share some of the same machines
   to do their work.

Contact Information

   Owner: Fedora Infrastructure Team

   Contact: #fedora-admin, sysadmin-build group

   Persons: mbonnet, dgilmore, f13, notting, mmcgrath, SmootherFrOgZ

   Location: Phoenix

   Servers: koji.fedoraproject.org, buildsys.fedoraproject.org,
   xenbuilder[1-4] , hammer1, ppc[1-4]

   Purpose: Build packages for Fedora.

Description

   Users submit builds to koji.fedoraproject.org or
   buildsys.fedoraproject.org. From there it gets passed on to the builders.

   At present plague and koji are unaware of each other. A result of this may
   be an overloaded builder. A easy fix for this is not clear at this time

Add packages into Buildroot

   Some contributors may have the need to build packages against fresh built
   packages which are not into buildroot yet. Koji has override tags as a
   Inheritance to the build tag in order to include them into buildroot which
   can be set by

 koji tag-pkg dist-$release-override <package_nvr>

Troubleshooting and Resolution

  Restarting Koji

   If for some reason koji needs to be restarted, make sure to restart the
   koji master first, then the builders. If the koji master has been down for
   a short enough time the builders do not need to be restarted.

 service httpd restart
 service kojira restart
 service kojid restart

   [60]Important.png
   If postgres becomes interrupted in some way, koji will need to be
   restarted. As long as the koji master daemon gets restarted the builders
   should reconnect automatically. If the db server has been restarted and
   the builders don't seem to be building, restart their daemons as well.

  kojid won't start or some builders won't connect

   In the event that some items are able to connect to koji while some are
   not, please make sure that the database is not filled up on connections.
   This is common if koji crashes and the db connections aren't properly
   cleared. Upon restart many of the connections are full so koji cannot
   reconnect. Clearing old connections is easy, guess about how long it the
   new koji has been up and pick a number of minutes larger then that and
   kill those queries. From db3 as postgres run:

 echo "select procpid from pg_stat_activity where usename='koji' and now() - query_start >= '00:40:00' order by query_start;" | psql koji | grep "^  " | xargs kill

  OOM (Out of Memory) Issues

   Out of memory issues occur from time to time on the build machines. There
   are a couple of options for correction. The first fix is to just restart
   the machine and hope it was a one time thing. If the problem continues
   please choose from one of the following options.

    Increase Memory

   The xen machines can have memory increased on their corresponding xen
   hosts. At present this is the table:

   +------------------------+
   | xen3     | xenbuilder1 |
   |----------+-------------|
   | xen4     | xenbuilder2 |
   |----------+-------------|
   | disabled | xenbuilder3 |
   |----------+-------------|
   | xen8     | xenbuilder4 |
   +------------------------+

   Edit /etc/xen/xenbuilder[1-4] and add more memory.

    Decrease weight

   Each builder has a weight as to how much work can be given to it.
   Presently the only way to alter weight is actually changing the database
   on db3:

 $ sudo su - postgres
 -bash-2.05b$ psql koji
 koji=# select * from host limit 1;
 id | user_id |          name          |  arches   | task_load | capacity | ready | enabled
 ----+---------+------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+-------+---------
 6 |     130 | ppc3.fedora.redhat.com | ppc ppc64 |       1.5 |        4 | t     | t
 (1 row)
 koji=# update host set capacity=2 where name='ppc3.fedora.redhat.com';

   Simply update capacity to a lower number.

  Disk Space Issues

   The builders use a lot of temporary storage. Failed builds also get left
   on the builders, most should get cleaned but plague does not. The easiest
   thing to do is remove some older cache dirs.

   Step one is to turn off both koji and plague:

 /etc/init.d/plague-builder stop
 /etc/init.d/kojid stop

   Next check to see what file system is full:

 df -h

   [61]Important.png
   If any one of the following directories is full, send an outage
   notification as outlined in: [62]Infrastructure/OutageTemplate to the
   fedora-infrastructure-list and fedora-devel-list, then contact Mike
   McGrath

    1. /mnt/koji
    2. /mnt/ntap-fedora1/scratch
    3. /pub/epel
    4. /pub/fedora

   Typically just / will be full. The next thing to do is determine if we
   have any extremely large builds left on the builder. Typical locations
   include /var/lib/mock and /mnt/build (/mnt/build actually is on the local
   filesystem):

 du -sh /var/lib/mock/* /mnt/build/*

     * /var/lib/mock/dist-f8-build-10443-1503: classic koji build
     * /var/lib/mock/fedora-6-ppc-core-57cd31505683ef1afa533197e91608c5a2c52864:
       classic plague build

   If nothing jumps out immediately, just start deleting files older than one
   week. Once enough space has been freed start koji and plague back up:

 /etc/init.d/plague-builder start
 /etc/init.d/kojid start

   Should there be mention of being sure filesystems in chroots are unmounted
                         before you delete the chroots?
