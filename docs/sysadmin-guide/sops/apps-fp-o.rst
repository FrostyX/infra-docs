Purpose:
  Have a nice landing page for all our webapps.

Description
===========

We have a number of webapps, many of which our users don't know about.  This
page was created so there was a central place where users could stumble
through them and learn.

The page is generated by a ansible role in ansible/roles/apps-fp-o/
It makes use of an RPM package, the source code for which is at
https://github.com/fedora-infra/apps.fp.o

You can update the page by updating the apps.yaml file in that ansible
module.

When ansible is run next, the two ansible handlers should see your
changes and regenerate the static html and json data for the page.
