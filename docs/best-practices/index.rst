Application Best Practices
==========================

Developers working on the Fedora Infrastructure applications often maintain
many projects. Furthermore, they regularly review patches for projects they
don't necessarily maintain themselves. Historically, there has been a great
deal of variance from project to project based on the particular author's
preferences. This project attempts to document a set of basic guidelines for
applications to follow. The advantage of agreeing upon and following these
guidelines is that developers can maintain a set of expectations when working
on an application.
