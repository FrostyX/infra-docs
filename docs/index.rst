===================================
Fedora Infrastructure Documentation
===================================

This contains a development and system administration guide for the Fedora
Infrastructure team.

The development guide covers how to get started with application development
as well as application best practices. You will also find several sample
projects that serve as demonstrations of these best practices and as an
excellent starting point for new projects.

The system administration guide covers how to get involved in the system
administration side of Fedora Infrastructure as well as the standard operating
procedures (SOPs) we use.


.. _getting-started:

Getting Started
===============

Fedora Infrastructure is full of projects that need help. In fact, there is so
much work to do, it can be a little overwhelming. This document is intended to
help you get ready to contribute to the Fedora Infrastructure.


Create a Fedora Account
-----------------------

The first thing you should do is create a `Fedora account`_. Your `Fedora
account`_ will be used for nearly everything you do as a member of the Fedora
community.

Once you've created your `Fedora account`_, you need to read and sign the
`Fedora Project Contributor Agreement`_ (FPCA).


Subscribe to the Mailing List
-----------------------------

Next, you should join the `Fedora Infrastructure mailing list`_. You will need
to log into your new `Fedora account`_ to subscribe. The mailing list is the
best way to have a discussion with the entire Fedora Infrastructure community.


Join IRC
--------

Join us on `Internet Relay Chat`_ (IRC) to chat in real time. For a more
thorough introduction to IRC, check out the Fedora Magazine's `beginner's
guide to IRC`_. There are many Fedora IRC channels on `freenode`_. To start
with, you should check out the ``#fedora-admin`` and ``#fedora-apps`` channels.
These channels are for Fedora Infrastructure system administration and application
development, respectively.


Next Steps
----------

Congratulations, you are now ready to get involved in a project! If application
development is what you're interested in, check out our developer
:ref:`dev-getting-started` guide.

If system administration sounds more to your liking, see the system administrator
:ref:`sysadmin-getting-started` guide.
