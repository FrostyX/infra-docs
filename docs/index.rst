===================================
Fedora Infrastructure Documentation
===================================

This contains a development and system administration guide for the Fedora
Infrastructure team.

The development guide covers how to get started with application development
as well as application best practices. You will also find several sample
projects that serve as demonstrations of these best practices and as an
excellent starting point for new projects.


The system administration guide covers how to get involved in the system
administration side of Fedora Infrastructure as well as the standard operating
procedures (SOPs) we use.
