SELinux Infrastructure SOP

   SELinux is a fundamental part of our Operating System but still has a
   large learning curve and remains quite intimidating to both developers and
   system administrators. Fedora's Infrastructure has been growing at an
   unfathomable rate, and is full of custom software that needs to be locked
   down. The goal of this SOP is to make it simple to track down and fix
   SELinux policy related issues within Fedora's Infrastructure.

   Fully deploying SELinux is still an ongoing task, and can be tracked in
   fedora-infrastructure [45]ticket #230.

   Purpose: To ensure that we are able to fully wield the power of SELinux
   within our infrastructure.

Step One: Realizing you have a problem

    If you are trying to find a specific problem on a host go look in the
    audit.log per-host on our cental log server. See the syslog SOP for 
    more information.

Step Two: Tracking down the violation

   Generate SELinux policy allow rules from logs of denied operations. This
   is useful for getting a quick overview of what has been getting denied on
   the local machine.

 # audit2allow -la

   You can obtain more detailed audit messages by using ausearch to get the
   most recent violations

 # ausearch -m avc -ts recent

  Again -see the syslog SOP for more information here.

Step Three: Fixing the violation

   Below are examples of using our current puppet configuration to make
   SELinux deployment changes. These constructs are currently home-brewed,
   and do not exist in upstream Puppet. For these functions to work, you must
   ensure that the host or servergroup is configured with 'include selinux',
   which will enable SELinux in permissive mode. Once a host is properly
   configured, this can be changed to 'include selinux-enforcing' to enable
   SELinux Enforcing mode.

  Allowing ports

     semanage_port { '8081-8089': type => 'http_port_t', proto => 'tcp' }

  Toggling an SELinux boolean

   SELinux booleans, which can be viewed by running `semanage boolean -l`,
   can easily be configured using the following syntax within your puppet
   configuration.

     selinux_bool { 'httpd_can_network_connect_db': bool => 'on' }

  Setting custom context

   Our infrastructure contains many custom applications, which may utilize
   non-standard file locations. These issues can lead to trouble with
   SELinux, but they can easily be resolved by setting custom file context.

     semanage_fcontext { '/var/tmp/l10n-data(/.*)?':
         type => 'httpd_sys_content_t'
     }

  Deploying custom policy modules

     * Put your te file in modules/selinux-policy/files in puppet.
     * add a section to whatever node or service manifest like

      selinux-policy::custom { 'fedorapeople-git': }



  Fixing odd errors from the logs:
     If you see messages like this in the log reports:

 restorecon:/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts: Multiple same / specifications for /home/fedora.
 matchpathcon: / /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts: Multiple same / / specifications for /home/fedora.

Then it is likely you have an overlapping filecontext in your local selinux context configuration - in this case likely
one added by puppet accidentally.

To find it run this:
 semanage fcontext -l | grep /path/being/complained/about

sometimes it is just an ordering problem and reversing them solves it
other times it is just an overlap, period.

look at the context and delete the one you do not want or reorder.
To delete run:
semanage fcontext -d '/entry/you/wish/to/delete'

This just removes that filecontext - no need to worry about files being deleted.

Then rerun the triggering command and see if the problem is solved.
