Preparing the website for a release

  Update gpg key

   As the release approaches, watch the fedora-release package for a new key
   to be added. Use the update-gpg-keys script in the fedora-web git
   repository to add it to static/. Manually add it to /keys and /verify.

    Steps

   Get a copy of the new key(s) from the fedora-release repo

   http://git.fedorahosted.org/git/?p=fedora-release.git

   We usually obsolete keys at the same time, so as we add F-13 keys, we
   remove the F-10 keys from the fedora.gpg keyblock and move them on the
   /keys page to the "obsolete keys" section.

   Start by updating fedoraproject.org/update-gpg-keys and adding the keyids
   of any obsolete keys to the obsolete_keys list.

   Then run that script to add the new key(s):

    [fedora-web (f18-keys)]$ cd fedoraproject.org/
    [fedoraproject.org (f18-keys)]$ scripts/update-gpg-keys /path/to/RPM-GPG-KEY-fedora-18-primary

   This will add the key(s) to the keyblock in static/fedora.gpg and create a
   text file for the key in static/$KEYID.txt as well. Verify that these
   files have been created properly and contain all the keys that they
   should.

     * Handy checks: gpg static/fedora.gpg or gpg static/$KEYID.txt
     * Adding "--with-fingerprint" option will add the fingerprint to the
       output

   Next, add new key(s) to data/content/keys.html, and move any obsolete keys to
   the proper section in that document.  A script to aid in generating the HTML
   for new keys is at scripts/make-gpg-key-html.  It will print HTML to stdout
   for each RPM-GPG-KEY-* file given as arguments.  This is suitable for
   copy/paste (or directly importing if your editor supports this).

   Update data/content/verify.html to remove any obsolete keys from the list
   of keyid's.

   Carefully verify that the data is correct, 'make en test' and checking
   http://localhost:5000/keys and http://localhost:5000/verify is
   wise.

  Update LINGUAS and languages.conf file

   Let's clean our directories and update the po files in the fedora-web git
   repository

 $ make clean all

   Use the script to update the POT, POs and the LINGUAS file (at the root)

 $ ./l10N_update.sh -w fedoraproject.org

 $ make httpd/conf/languages.conf
 $ sed -i "s:@DOCUMENTROOT@:/srv/web/start.fedoraproject.org:g" languages.conf.in

   Commit changes

 $ git commit -a


  Prepare puppet commits

   Prior to release day, prepare puppet commits to move the fedora-web branch
   to the release (alpha, beta, final, whatever)

     * Update branch

          * Edit: modules/fedora-web/files/syncStatic.sh

     * Redirect /get-prerelease

          * Edit: modules/fedora-web/files/redirects.conf

Update website

  For Alpha

    1. add Alpha banner
    2. update the global variables

         2.1 change curr_state to 'Alpha'

         2.2 check that next_name reflect the name of the next release

    3. test and check all links in get-fedora.html, get-prerelease.html,
       verify.html

         3.1 Ensure href's are consistent with actual filenames of mirrored
            content.

             You should be able to find the paths in /pub on bapp01 (sudo
                 su - mirrormanager first)

         3.2 need link to rel-eng SOP here (RFE, doesn't exist yet)

         3.3 change the Release Notes link to the Alpha Release Notes wiki page

    4. modify:

         4.1 static/js/banner.js (alpha banner )
         4.2 data/content/verify.html (add the alpha GPG signature)

    5. add checksum files
         They should be in bapp01, could use the following command then scp:
         $ find /pub/fedora/linux/releases/test/17-Alpha/ -type f -name \
         *CHECKSUM* -exec cp '{}' . \;

    6. update the transifex resource
         See in tips to know how to do it

    7. add this build on stg.fedoraproject.org (puppet syncStatic.sh.stg)

  For Beta

    1. add countdown banners. Could use the
       static/images/counter/get_counter.sh script.

    2. update the global variables (curr_state to 'Beta')

    3. test and check all links in get-fedora.html, get-prerelease.html,
       verify.html

        3.1 Ensure href's are consistent with actual filenames of mirrored
            content

            You should be able to find the paths in /pub on bapp01 (sudo
                 su - mirrormanager first)

        3.2 need link to rel-eng SOP here (RFE, doesn't exist yet)

        3.3 change the Release Notes link to the fedorapeople Beta Release
            Notes (revert previous) 

    4. modify:

        4.1 data/content/index.html (define the release date)
        4.2 static/js/release-counter* (update dates/times, languages)
        4.3 static/js/banner.js (beta banner )

    5. remove:
          static/checksums/Fedora-XX-Alpha*

    6. add new checksums

    7. update the transifex resource
         See in tips to know how to do it

    8. add this build on stg.fedoraproject.org (puppet syncStatic.sh.stg)

  For GA

   Merge beta onto master branch

 $ git checkout master
 $ git merge f13-beta

   Manually edit the .pot files that are listed as conflicts and correct the
   transifex config file (fedoraproject.org/.tx/config) to use the correct resource

   Edit fedoraproject.org/build/globalvar.py to define curr_state = '' and updating iso_size

   Manually go to each site and 'make all test'

   On GA release day, tag repo F<release-number>.

   Update banner.js to reflect new banner (See file: /static/js/banners.js)
   Add the release banner in static/images/banners/ 
    (see https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/F17_Artwork/Submissions/Banners)

   update the static/checksums/ (and remove static/checksums/Fedora-XX-Beta*)

Fire in the hole

   After 9:15 AM EDT release day, push the puppet changes (e.g.: cd ~/puppet
   && git push). This timing ensures that the cron jobs will not
   automatically push the new website before 10:00 AM. Then, on puppet1 run:

  on lockbox01: 
  
  'sudo func-command --host=proxy\* --host=bapp01\* '/usr/local/bin/run-puppet nowait' 

   On bapp1, run:

 # Once /usr/local/bin/syncStatic on bapp1 is updated with your changes, run
 sudo -u apache /usr/local/bin/syncStatic

   This takes about 15 minutes, so try to do this well before you need to
   push the final site out.

   Finally, when releng gives the OK, run the following on the proxies to
   make the site live:

 # To sync the changes out, you can use func from puppet1 if you have sudo on puppet1.
 # Otherwise, SSH to the proxies and call the below command.
 sudo /usr/bin/rsync -a --no-owner --no-group bapp01::fedoraproject.org/* /srv/web/fedoraproject.org/

 # you probably want to do the other sites too
 sudo func-command --host=proxy\* "/usr/bin/rsync -a --no-owner --no-group bapp1.vpn.fedoraproject.org::spins.fedoraproject.org/* /srv/web/spins.fedoraproject.org/"
 sudo func-command --host=proxy\* "/usr/bin/rsync -a --no-owner --no-group bapp1.vpn.fedoraproject.org::start.fedoraproject.org/* /srv/web/start.fedoraproject.org/"

   Push commit to redirect get-prerelease to get-fedora. If you have sudo on
   puppet1, run:

  sudo func-command --host=proxy\* "/usr/bin/rsync -a --no-owner --no-group bapp1.vpn.fedoraproject.org::fedoraproject.org/* /srv/web/fedoraproject.org/"

   Otherwise, manually run this on each proxy server:

   $ sudo /usr/bin/rsync -a --no-owner --no-group
   bapp1.vpn.fedoraproject.org::fedoraproject.org/*
   /srv/web/fedoraproject.org/

   If necessary, clear proxy caches using

   $ rm -rf /srv/cache/mod_cache/*

   Update the static banner on start.fedoraproject.org. The procedure is the
   same as with fedoraproject.org, except that the command to run on the
   proxies is

   $ sudo /usr/bin/rsync -a --no-owner --no-group
   bapp1.vpn.fedoraproject.org::start.fedoraproject.org/*
   /srv/web/start.fedoraproject.org/

Tips

  Creating Branches

   Alpha

 $git push origin master:refs/heads/f13-alpha

   Beta

 $git push origin f13-alpha:refs/heads/f13-beta

  Checking Out Branch

 $git checkout -t origin/f13-alpha
 OR
 $git checkout -t -b f13-alpha origin/f13-alpha

  Merging branches

   Suggested by Ricky

 $ git merge f13-beta
 $ git checkout --theirs f13-beta [list of conflicting po files]
 $ git commit

  alpha/beta banners (static/js/banner.js)

    [
     "https://fedoraproject.org/static/images/banners/f13alpha.png",
     "Fedora 13 Alpha",
     "https://fedoraproject.org/get-prerelease",
     5
   ],

 update the transifex resource
 
 block the current resource to not let translators submit on the "old" branch
 log at
https://fedora.transifex.com/projects/p/fedora-web/resource/fedoraproject-org-master/edit/
 for example.
 
 once you've created the new branch, and make necessary html changes
 $ git checkout f17-alpha

 pull the up to date translations 
 $ make pullpos

 edit the .tx/config file, the resource name should be updated to create the
 new one, like:
 [fedora-web.fedoraproject-org-f17-alpha]

 create the remote resource
 $ tx push -s

 push current translations to the new resource. --skip don't stop if failed to
push (fails if no translated strings)
 $ tx push -t --skip
 
 refresh the pot
 $ make pot

 then commit and push your .tx/config and pot files.
 Please log to https://fedora.transifex.net/projects/p/fedora-web/resources/
 and set the important flag, then notice translators.
